24. doi: 10.1007/s00592-017-1063-1.","AIMS: This prospective study focuses on risk factors for arterial damage in children with type 1 diabetes (T1D). METHODS: Eighty children and adolescents with T1D were investigated twice, approximately 2 years apart, for carotid artery intima-media thickness (cIMT) and compliance (CAC), flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) of the brachial artery, and plasma levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-8. All subjects were genotyped for HLA. The number of respiratory tract infections (RTI) during the past year was obtained by a questionnaire in 56 patients. RESULTS: cIMT progression, defined as percentage (%) change of cIMT from baseline, correlated inversely with the % changes of both CAC (p = 0.04, r = - 0.3; n = 62) and FMD (p = 0.03, r = - 0.3; n = 47). In multivariate analysis, RTI frequency correlated significantly with cIMT progression irrespective of age, diabetes duration, BMI, and HbA1c (p = 0.03, r = 0.3). When patients were divided in relation to RTI, the association of DQ2/8 with cIMT progression remained significant in patients with over three infections/year (p = 0.04, r = 0.3). During follow-up, the group of DQ2/8 patients with hsCRP > 1 mg/l showed significantly higher levels of plasma MMP-8 than the non-DQ2/8 group. CONCLUSIONS: The diabetes-risk genotype DQ2/8 and systemic inflammation contribute to pro-atherosclerotic vascular changes in children and adolescents with T1D.","type+1+diabetes"],["[Importance of dental care to maintain oral health of children and youth with type 1 diabetes].",["Kuzmiuk A","Marczuk-Kolada G","Luczaj-Cepowicz E","Obidzinska M","Chorzewska E","Wasilczuk U","Kierklo A","Szajda SD"],"Med Pr. 2017 Oct 24. pii: 75723. doi: 10.13075/mp.5893.00554.","BACKGROUND: Dental care for children and youth with type 1 diabetes should rely on reliable examination of the oral cavity, early treatment of dental caries and maintenance of the treatment results. This can be achieved through regular control visits consistent with the standards, and also through following the recommendations for prevention of dental caries and periodontal disease. The aim of the study was to investigate whether dental care allows to preserve good oral health of children and youth with type 1 diabetes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 60 patients with type 1 diabetes, aged 7-17 years, and 30 healthy children and youth within the same age range. There were evaluated intensity of caries, the effectiveness of conservative treatment, periodontal health and oral hygiene. RESULTS: The results of examinations showed significantly lower caries prevalence and better periodontal health in the children and youth with type 1 diabetes. The effectiveness of conservative treatment was significantly higher among patients with mixed dentition. There was no significant difference in oral hygiene between the compared groups. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes is a risk factor for oral diseases, so children and youth with type 1 diabetes should be provided with special preventive care and curative measures. The main goal of the insulin-dependent diabetes care program is to early classify them to highrisk groups to improve general oral health and thus improve the quality of life. Proper dental care for children and yuoth with type 1 diabetes is a condition to maintain oral health.

However, whether irisin influences the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated the potential role and mechanism of action of irisin in diabetes-induced myocardial dysfunction in mice. Type 1 diabetes was induced in mice by injecting streptozotocin, and the diabetic mice were administered recombinant r-irisin (low or high dose: 0.5 or 1.5 mug/g body weight/day, I.P.) or PBS for 16 weeks. Irisin treatment did not alter blood glucose levels in the diabetic mice. However, the results of echocardiographical and histopathological assays indicated that low-dose irisin treatment alleviated cardiac fibrosis and left ventricular function in the diabetic mice, whereas high-dose irisin failed to mitigate the ventricular function impairment and increased collagen deposition. The potential mechanism underlying the effect of low-dose irisin involved irisin-mediated inhibition of high glucose-induced endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT); conversely, high-dose irisin treatment enhanced high glucose-induced MMP expression by stimulating MAPK (p38 and ERK) signalling and cardiac fibroblast proliferation and migration. Low-dose irisin alleviated DCM development by inhibiting high glucose-induced EndMT. By contrast, high-dose irisin disrupted normal MMP expression and induced cardiac fibroblast proliferation and migration, which results in excess collagen deposition. Thus, irisin can inhibit high glucose-induced EndMT and exert a dose-dependent bidirectional effect on DCM.","type+1+diabetes"],["Improvements in peripheral vascular function with vitamin D treatment in deficient adolescents with type 1 diabetes.",["Deda L","Yeshahayu Y","Sud S","Cuerden M","Cherney DZ","Sochett EB","Mahmud FH"],"Pediatr Diabetes. 2017 Oct 23. doi: 10.1111/pedi.12595.","BACKGROUND: Vitamin D (VitD) deficiency is prevalent in adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and is associated with diabetes-related vascular complications in adulthood. The objective of this clinical trial was to assess VitD treatment on endothelial function (EF) and markers of renal inflammation, in this patient group. METHODS: Adolescents with T1D with suboptimal levels of VitD (<37.5 nmol/L) were treated for 12 to 24 weeks with a VitD analog (VitD3 ) at doses of 1000 or 2000 IU daily. The primary end-point assessed the change in reactive hyperemia index (lnRHI), a measure of EF. Secondary end-points included changes in blood pressure, lipid profile, HbA1c and albumin creatinine ratio (ACR). Urinary cytokine/chemokine inflammatory profile was also assessed in a subset of subjects posttreatment. RESULTS: Two hundred and seventy-one subjects were screened for VitD status and 31 VitD deficient subjects with a mean age of 15.7 +/- 1.4 years were enrolled and completed the study. Mean 25-OH-VitD levels significantly increased (33.0 +/- 12.8 vs 67.0 +/- 23.2 nmol/L, P < .01) with a significant improvement in EF following VitD supplementation (lnRHI 0.58 +/- 0.20 vs 0.68 +/- 0.21, P = .03). VitD supplementation did not significantly impact systolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP), lipids, HbA1c and ACR and no adverse effects were seen. Several urinary inflammatory cytokines/chemokines: MCP-3 (P < .01), epidermal growth factor (EGF) (P < .01) tumor necrosis factor beta (TNFbeta) (P = .01), interleukin-10 (IL-10) (P = .01), also significantly decreased post-VitD-treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with VitD was associated with an improvement in EF and reduced expression of urinary inflammatory markers in adolescents with T1D.

RECENT FINDINGS: The prevalence of CAN increases with age and duration of diabetes. Further risk factors for CAN comprise poor glycemic control, dyslipidemia, abdominal obesity, hypertension, and the presence of diabetic complications. CAN has been also linked to reduced CRF. We recently showed that CRF parameters (e.g., maximal oxidative capacity or oxidative capacity at the anaerobic threshold) are associated with cardiac autonomic function in patients recently diagnosed with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Exercise interventions have shown that physical activity can increase cardiovagal activity and reduce sympathetic overactivity. In particular, long-term and regularly, but also supervised, performed endurance and high-intense and high-volume exercise improves cardiac autonomic function in patients with type 2 diabetes. By contrast, the evidence in those with type 1 diabetes and also in individuals with prediabetes or metabolic syndrome is weaker. Overall, the studies reviewed herein addressing the question whether favorably modulating the autonomic nervous system may improve CRF during exercise programs support the therapeutic concept to promote physical activity and to achieve physical fitness. However, high-quality exercise interventions, especially in type 1 diabetes and metabolic syndrome including prediabetes, are further required to better understand the relationship between physical activity, fitness, and cardiac autonomic function.","type+1+diabetes"],["Decreased quality of life and treatment satisfaction in patients with latent autoimmune diabetes of the adult.",["Granado-Casas M","Martinez-Alonso M","Alcubierre N","Ramirez-Morros A","Hernandez M","Castelblanco E","Torres-Puiggros J","Mauricio D"],"PeerJ. 2017 Oct 18;5:e3928. doi: 10.7717/peerj.3928. eCollection 2017.","OBJECTIVES: Our main aim was to assess the quality of life (QoL) and treatment satisfaction (TS) of subjects with LADA (latent autoimmune diabetes of the adult) and compare these measures with those of patients with other diabetes types, i.e., type 1 (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study with a total of 48 patients with LADA, 297 patients with T2DM and 124 with T1DM. The Audit of Diabetes-Dependent Quality of Life (ADDQoL-19) questionnaire and the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ) were administered. Relevant clinical variables were also assessed. The data analysis included comparisons between groups and multivariate linear models. RESULTS: The LADA patients presented lower diabetes-specific QoL (p = 0.045) and average weighted impact scores (p = 0.007) than the T2DM patients. The subgroup of LADA patients with diabetic retinopathy (DR) who were treated with insulin had a lower ADDQoL average weighted impact score than the other diabetic groups. Although the overall measure of TS was not different between the LADA and T2DM (p = 0.389) and T1DM (p = 0.091) groups, the patients with LADA showed a poorer hyperglycemic frequency perception than the T2DM patients (p < 0.001) and an improved frequency of hypoglycemic perception compared with the T1DM patients (p = 0.021). CONCLUSIONS: The current findings suggest a poorer quality of life, especially in terms of DR and insulin treatment, among patients with LADA compared with those with T1DM and T2DM. Hyperglycemia frequency perception was also poorer in the LADA patients than in the T1DM and T2DM patients.

The aim of the present study was to investigate real-world incidence and predictors of hypoglycaemia in insulin-treated patients. METHODS: More than 300 consecutive patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes treated with insulin were enrolled during regular out-patient visits from 36 diabetes practices throughout the whole country. They completed a comprehensive questionnaire on hypoglycaemia knowledge, awareness, and incidence in the last month and last six months. In addition, in the prospective part, patients recorded incidence of hypoglycaemic events using a special diary prospectively on a daily basis, through 4 weeks. RESULTS: At least one hypoglycaemic event was self-reported in 84.1%, and 56.4% of patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, respectively, during the prospective period of 4 weeks. 43.4% and 26.2% of patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, respectively, experienced a nocturnal hypoglycaemic event. In the same time-period, severe hypoglycaemia was experienced by 15.9% and 7.1% of patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, respectively. Lower glycated haemoglobin was not a significant predictor of hypoglycaemia. CONCLUSIONS: Rates of self-reported hypoglycaemia in patients treated with insulin in the largest and most comprehensive study in Slovenia so far are higher than reported from randomised control trials, but comparable to data from observational studies. Hypoglycaemia incidence was high even with high glycated haemoglobin values.","type+1+diabetes"],["Morbid Sequences Suggest Molecular Mimicry between Microbial Peptides and Self-Antigens: A Possibility of Inciting Autoimmunity.",["Pahari S","Chatterjee D","Negi S","Kaur J","Singh B","Agrewala JN"],"Front Microbiol. 2017 Oct 9;8:1938. doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2017.01938. eCollection 2017.","Understanding etiology of autoimmune diseases has been a great challenge for designing drugs and vaccines. The pathophysiology of many autoimmune diseases may be attributed to molecular mimicry provoked by microbes. Molecular mimicry hypothesizes that a sequence homology between foreign and self-peptides leads to cross-activation of autoreactive T cells. Different microbial proteins are implicated in various autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis, human type 1 diabetes, primary biliary cirrhosis and rheumatoid arthritis. It may be imperative to identify the microbial epitopes that initiate the activation of autoreactive T cells. Consequently, in the present study, we employed immunoinformatics tools to delineate homologous antigenic regions between microbes and human proteins at not only the sequence level but at the structural level too. Interestingly, many cross-reactive MHC class II binding epitopes were detected from an array of microbes. Further, these peptides possess a potential to skew immune response toward Th1-like patterns. The present study divulges many microbial target proteins, their putative MHC-binding epitopes, and predicted structures to establish the fact that both sequence and structure are two important aspects for understanding the relationship between molecular mimicry and autoimmune diseases. Such findings may enable us in designing potential immunotherapies to tolerize autoreactive T cells.","type+1+diabetes"],["Visual-evoked potentials in children and adolescents with newly diagnosed diabetes.",["Lee SS","Han HS","Kim H"],"Turk Pediatri Ars. 2017 Sep 1;52(3):133-137. doi: 10.5152/TurkPediatriArs.2017.4979. eCollection 2017 Sep.","AIM: Central nervous system impairment is common in patients with diabetes, even in the early stages of the disease.

RESULTS: P100 latencies were significantly delayed in patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes compared with control subjects (p<0.001). There was no correlation between P100 latencies and age at diagnosis. No correlations were found between P100 latencies and HbA1c values in patients with type 1 diabetes. However, P100 latencies were significantly associated with levels of HbA1c in patients with type 2 diabetes (p<0.01). There was a marked inter-individual variability in amplitudes of N75 to P100 in both patients with diabetes and controls. The amplitudes of N75 to P100 were not associated with levels of HbA1c in patients with diabetes. Negative correlations between amplitudes of N75 to P100 and age at diagnosis were noted in patients with type 1 diabetes (p<0.05).

We hypothesized that superimposition of hypertension on diabetic mouse models would accelerate DKD. To test this possibility, we induced persistent hypertension in three mouse models of type 1 diabetes and two models of type 2 diabetes by adeno-associated virus delivery of renin (ReninAAV). Compared with LacZAAV-treated counterparts, ReninAAV-treated type 1 diabetic Akita/129 mice exhibited a substantial increase in albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) and serum creatinine level and more severe renal lesions. In type 2 models of diabetes (C57BKLS db/db and BTBR ob/ob mice), compared with LacZAAV, ReninAAV induced significant elevations in ACR and increased the incidence and severity of histopathologic findings, with increased serum creatinine detected only in the ReninAAV-treated db/db mice. The uninephrectomized ReninAAV db/db model was the most progressive model examined and further characterized. In this model, separate treatment of hyperglycemia with rosiglitazone or hypertension with lisinopril partially reduced ACR, consistent with independent contributions of these disorders to renal disease. Microarray analysis and comparison with human DKD showed common pathways affected in human disease and this model. These results identify novel models of progressive DKD that provide researchers with a facile and reliable method to study disease pathogenesis and support the development of therapeutics.","type+1+diabetes"],["Response to Comment on Craig et al.

Mobile health (mHealth) apps show promise in supporting self-management of chronic conditions such as type 1 diabetes. Many health care providers become involved in app development. Unfortunately, limited information is available to guide their selection of appropriate methods, techniques, and tools for a participatory design (PD) project in health care. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to develop an mHealth app to support young people in self-managing type 1 diabetes. This paper presents our methodological recommendations based on experiences and reflections from a 2-year research study. METHODS: A mixed methods design was used to identify user needs before designing the app and testing it in a randomized controlled trial. App design was based on qualitative, explorative, interventional, and experimental activities within an overall iterative PD approach. Several techniques and tools were used, including workshops, a mail panel, think-aloud tests, and a feasibility study. RESULTS: The final mHealth solution was \"Young with Diabetes\" (YWD). The iterative PD approach supported researchers and designers in understanding the needs of end users (ie, young people, parents, and health care providers) and their assessment of YWD, as well as how to improve app usability and feasibility. It is critical to include all end user groups during all phases of a PD project and to establish a multidisciplinary team to provide the wide range of expertise required to build a usable and useful mHealth app. CONCLUSIONS: Future research is needed to develop and evaluate more efficient PD techniques. Health care providers need guidance on what tools and techniques to choose for which subgroups of users and guidance on how to introduce an app to colleagues to successfully implement an mHealth app in health care organizations. These steps are important for anyone who wants to design an mHealth app for any illness.","type+1+diabetes"],["Comparison of Continuous Glucose Monitoring in Adolescents with Type 1 Diabetes.

This entails carefully monitoring blood glucose levels and taking corrective steps whenever they are too high or too low. If blood glucose levels could be accurately predicted, patients could take proactive steps to prevent blood glucose excursions from occurring. However, accurate predictions require complex physiological models of blood glucose behavior. Factors such as insulin boluses, carbohydrate intake, and exercise influence blood glucose in ways that are difficult to capture through manually engineered equations. In this paper, we describe a recursive neural network (RNN) approach that uses long short-term memory (LSTM) units to learn a physiological model of blood glucose. When trained on raw data from real patients, the LSTM networks (LSTMs) obtain results that are competitive with a previous state-of-the-art model based on manually engineered physiological equations. The RNN approach can incorporate arbitrary physiological parameters without the need for sophisticated manual engineering, thus holding the promise of further improvements in prediction accuracy.","type+1+diabetes"],["Kernel-based adaptive learning improves accuracy of glucose predictive modelling in type 1 diabetes: A proof-of-concept study.",["Georga EI","Principe JC","Rizos EC","Fotiadis DI"],"Conf Proc IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc. 2017 Jul;2017:2765-2768. doi: 10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037430.","This study aims at demonstrating the need for nonlinear recursive models to the identification and prediction of the dynamic glucose system in type 1 diabetes.

The method is evaluated on seven people with type 1 diabetes in free-living conditions, where a change in glycaemic dynamics is forced by increasing the level of physical activity in the middle of the observational period. The univariate input allows for short-term (</=30 min) predictions with KRLS-ALD reaching an average root mean square error of 15.22+/-5.95 mgdL-1 and an average time lag of 17.14+/-2.67 min for an horizon of 30 min.

Design, Setting, and Participants: The Behavioral Economic Incentives to Improve Glycemic Control Among Adolescents and Young Adults With Type 1 Diabetes (BE IN CONTROL) study was an investigator-blinded, 6-month, 2-arm randomized clinical trial conducted between January 22 and November 2, 2016, with 3-month intervention and follow-up periods. Ninety participants (aged 14-20) with suboptimally controlled type 1 diabetes (hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] >8.0%) were recruited from the Diabetes Center for Children at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Interventions: All participants were given daily blood glucose monitoring goals of 4 or more checks per day with 1 or more level within the goal range (70-180 mg/dL) collected with a wireless glucometer. The 3-month intervention consisted of a $60 monthly incentive in a virtual account, from which $2 was subtracted for every day of nonadherence to the monitoring goals. During a 3-month follow-up period, the intervention was discontinued. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was change in HbA1c levels at 3 months. Secondary outcomes included adherence to glucose monitoring and change in HbA1c levels at 6 months. All analyses were by intention to treat. Results: Of the 181 participants screened, 90 (52 [57.8%] girls) were randomized to the intervention (n = 45) or control (n = 45) arms. The mean (SD) age was 16.3 (1.9) years. The intervention group had significantly greater adherence to glucose monitoring goals in the incentive period (50.0% vs 18.9%; adjusted difference, 27.2%; 95% CI, 9.5% to 45.0%; P = .003) but not in the follow-up period (15.3% vs 8.7%; adjusted difference, 3.9%; 95% CI, -2.0% to 9.9%; P = .20).

METHODS: Nine streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rhesus monkeys were transplanted with adult porcine islets isolated from designated pathogen-free (DPF) miniature pigs. They were treated with anti-CD40 mAb-based immunosuppressive regimen and were divided into 3 groups: anti-CD40 only group (n = 2), belatacept group (anti-CD40 mAb+belatacept, n = 2), and tacrolimus group (anti-CD40 mAb+tacrolimus, n = 5). All monkeys received anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG), cobra venom factor (CVF), adalimumab, and sirolimus. Blood glucose levels (BGL) and serum porcine C-peptide concentrations were measured. Humoral and cellular immune responses were assessed by ELISA and ELISPOT, respectively. Liver biopsy and subsequent immunohistochemistry were conducted. RESULTS: All animals restored normoglycemia immediately after porcine islet transplantation and finished the follow-up without any severe adverse effects except for one animal (R092). Most animals maintained their body weight. Median survival, as defined by a serum porcine C-peptide concentration of >0.15 ng/mL, was 31, 27, and 60 days for anti-CD40 only, belatacept, and tacrolimus groups, respectively. Anti-alphaGal IgG levels in serum and the number of interferon-gamma secreting T cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells did not increase in most animals.

METHODS: Data from 5 phase 3 trials were pooled into 3 analysis groups: type 2 diabetes (T2D) treated with basal insulin only, T2D treated with basal-bolus therapy, and type 1 diabetes (T1D). A generalized boosted model was used post hoc to assess the relationship of the following variables with glycemic control parameters (HbA1c and DMG): within-day GV, between-day GV (calculated using self-monitored blood glucose and fasting blood glucose [FBG]), hypoglycemia rate, and certain baseline characteristics. RESULTS: Within-day GV (calculated using standard deviation [SD]) was found to have a significant influence on endpoints HbA1c and DMG in all 3 patient groups. Between-day GV from FBG (calculated using SD), within-day GV (calculated using coefficient of variation), and hypoglycemia rate were found to significantly influence the endpoint HbA1c in the T2D basal-only group.

Currently, humans at high future T1D risk can only be identified at late prodromal stages of disease indicated by markers such as insulin autoantibodies. When commenced in already insulin autoantibody+ NOD mice, continuous BAFFR-Fc treatment alone or in combination with anti-CD20 (designated combo therapy) inhibited T1D development. Despite eliciting broader B lymphocyte depletion, continuous combo therapy afforded no greater T1D protection than did BAFFR-Fc alone. As previously observed, late disease stage-initiated anti-CD20 monotherapy did not inhibit T1D, and in this study was additionally found to be associated with development of drug-blocking Abs. Promisingly, NOD mice given transient late disease stage BAFFR-Fc monotherapy were rendered T1D resistant. However, combo treatment abrogated the protective effect of transient BAFFR-Fc monotherapy. NOD mice receiving transient BAFF blockade were characterized by an enrichment of regulatory B lymphocytes that inhibit T1D development through IL-10 production, but this population is sensitive to deletion by anti-CD20 treatment. B lymphocytes from transient BAFFR-Fc-treated mice suppressed T cell proliferation to a greater extent than did those from controls. Proportions of B lymphocytes expressing CD73, an ecto-enzyme operating in a pathway converting proinflammatory ATP to anti-inflammatory adenosine, were also temporarily increased by transient BAFFR-Fc treatment, but not anti-CD20 therapy. These collective studies indicate transient BAFFR-Fc-mediated B lymphocyte depletion elicits long-term T1D protection by enriching regulatory B lymphocytes that are deleted by anti-CD20 cotherapy.","type+1+diabetes"],["Mental Health and Well-Being among Type 1 Diabetes Caregivers in India: Evidence from The IDREAM Study.",["Capistrant BD","Friedemann-Sanchez G","Novak LK","Zuijdwijk C","Ogle GD","Pendsey S"],"Diabetes Res Clin Pract. 2017 Oct 17. pii: S0168-8227(17)31103-8. doi: 10.1016/j.diabres.2017.10.009.","AIMS: Although more than half of the world's children with T1D live in developing countries, still little is known about how caregiving for children with T1D affects the parent/caregivers' health in low- and middle-income country settings.

In this previous study, time spent in normoglycemia (the primary outcome), was improved by 9.6% (p<0.0001). We performed post-hoc analyses using a zero-inflated Poisson regression model to assess the relationship between severe hypoglycemia and HbA1c, glucose variability and duration of diabetes. RESULTS: During SMBG use, HbA1c and the number of severe hypoglycemic events were negatively associated (OR 0.20 [95% CI 0.09 to 0.44]).

METHODS: This study included 130 pubescent children: 94 with T1D (188 eyes) and 36 of their age-matched control group (60 eyes). OCTA was performed using AngioVue (Avanti, Optivue). FAZ area (mm2) in superficial plexus, whole superficial capillary vessel density (wsVD), fovea superficial vessel density (fsVD), parafovea superficial vessel density (psVD), whole deep vessel density (wdVD), fovea deep vessel density (fdVD), parafovea deep vessel density (pdVD), foveal thickness (FT) (mum) and parafoveal thickness (PFT) (mum) were taken into analysis. Among the studied patients with T1D there were assessed codependences regarding the investigated foveal and parafoveal parameters and selected potential predictors, i.e. patient's age (years), diabetes duration time (years), age of onset of the disease (years), mean level of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) (%), and concentration of serum creatinine (mg/dL). RESULTS: None of the abovementioned OCT and OCTA parameters was statistically significantly different between the groups. The patient's age statistically significantly did not influent any of the OCT and OCTA parameters. Yet an elevated level of HbA1C tended to reduce the parafovea superficial vessel density (p = 0.039), and parafoveal thickness (p = 0.003) and an increased serum creatinine level correlated with the decreased whole deep vessel density (p < 0.001). The parafovea deep vessel density in the diabetic patients decreased when the serum creatinine level (p = 0.008), age of onset of the disease (p = 0.028), and diabetes duration time (p = 0.014) rose. CONCLUSIONS: Vessel density, both in superficial and deep plexuses, and FAZ area are normal in pubescent children with T1D comparing to healthy subjects. An elevated level of HbA1C correlated with reduced psVD and PFT.

A promising treatment strategy for T1D is the replacement of the lost beta cell mass through implantation of immune-isolated microencapsulated islets referred to as the bioartificial pancreas. The goal of this approach is to restore blood glucose regulation and prevent the long-term comorbidities of T1D without the need for immunosuppressants. A major requirement in the quest to achieve this goal is to address the oxygen needs of islet cells. Islets are highly metabolically active and require a significant amount of oxygen for normal function. During the process of isolation, microencapsulation, and processing prior to transplantation, the islets' oxygen supply is disrupted, and a large amount of islet cells are therefore lost due to extended hypoxia, thus creating a major barrier to clinical success with this treatment. In this work, we have investigated the oxygen generating compounds, sodium percarbonate (SPO) and calcium peroxide (CPO) as potential supplemental oxygen sources for islets during isolation and encapsulation before and immediately after transplantation. First, SPO particles were used as an oxygen source for islets during isolation. Secondly, silicone films containing SPO were used to provide supplemental oxygen to islets for up to 4 days in culture. Finally, CPO was used as an oxygen source for encapsulated cells by co-encapsulating CPO particles with islets in permselective alginate microspheres. These studies provide an important proof of concept for the utilization of these oxygen generating materials to prevent beta cell death caused by hypoxia.","type+1+diabetes"],["The additive effects of atorvastatin and insulin on renal function and renal organic anion transporter 3 function in diabetic rats.",["Thongnak L","Pongchaidecha A","Jaikumkao K","Chatsudthipong V","Chattipakorn N","Lungkaphin A"],"Sci Rep. 2017 Oct 19;7(1):13532. doi: 10.1038/s41598-017-13206-5.","Hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress is usually found in diabetic condition. 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, statins, are widely used as cholesterol-lowering medication with several \"pleiotropic\" effects in diabetic patients.

BPA is of concern for developmental exposure resulting in immunomodulation and disease development due to its ability to cross the placental barrier and presence in breast milk. BPA can use various mechanisms to modulate the immune system and affect diseases, including agonistic and antagonistic effects on many receptors (e.g., estrogen receptors), epigenetic modifications, acting on cell signaling pathways and, likely, the gut microbiome. Immune cell populations and function from the innate and adaptive immune system are altered by developmental BPA exposure, including decreased T regulatory (Treg) cells and upregulated pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Developmental BPA exposure can also contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus, allergy, asthma and mammary cancer disease by altering immune function. Multiple sclerosis and type 1 diabetes mellitus may also be exacerbated by BPA, although more research is needed. Additionally, BPA analogs, such as bisphenol S (BPS), have been increasing in use, and currently, little is known about their immune effects. Therefore, more studies should be conducted to determine if developmental exposure BPA and its analogs modulate immune responses and lead to immune-related diseases.","type+1+diabetes"],["Nicotine and Autoimmunity: the Lotus' Flower in Tobacco.",["Gomes JP","Watad A","Shoenfeld Y"],"Pharmacol Res. 2017 Oct 16. pii: S1043-6618(17)30905-2. doi: 10.1016/j.phrs.2017.10.005.","Nicotine, the major component of cigarettes, has demonstrated conflicting impact on the immune system: some authors suggest that increases pro-inflammatory cytokines and provokes cellular apoptosis of neutrophils, releasing intracellular components that act as auto-antigens; others claimed that nicotine has a protective and anti-inflammatory effects, especially by binding to alpha7 subunit of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.

Oxidative stress is the cause and consequence of numerous diseases including type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), in which there is selective destruction of insulin producing pancreatic beta-cells. Studies have documented that hyperglycemia produces profound stress. In vivo production of numerous reactive oxygen, nitrogen, chlorine species and lipid/sugar oxidation products are result of persistent hyperglycemia. Post-translational modifications by reactive species may create new antigenic epitopes and play a role in the development of autoimmune response. In this paper our main focus was to establish the effect of existing hyperglycemia induced oxido-nitrosative stress in T1DM patients on the integrity of human serum albumin. Raised nitric oxide, carbonyl, RBC hemolysis, lowered ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), thiol and deformed RBC in T1DM are all highly suggestive of persistent oxido-nitrosative stress. Hyperglycemia induced generation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) was established by LCMS. Chronic oxido-nitrosative stress can modify HSA in T1DM patients, producing immunologically active albumin. Therefore, it is speculated that the aberrant HSA may play a role in the initiation/progression of T1DM.","type+1+diabetes"],["The effect of health on socioeconomic status: Using instrumental variables to revisit a successful randomized controlled trial.",["Daepp MIG","Arcaya MC"],"Econ Hum Biol. 2017 Sep 25. pii: S1570-677X(17)30057-6. doi: 10.1016/j.ehb.2017.09.002.","Poor health is widely recognized as a consequence of social disadvantage, but health problems may also help transmit social disadvantage over time and generations.

Objective: To determine whether rates of severe hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis are lower with insulin pump therapy compared with insulin injection therapy in children, adolescents, and young adults with type 1 diabetes. Design, Setting, and Participants: Population-based cohort study conducted between January 2011 and December 2015 in 446 diabetes centers participating in the Diabetes Prospective Follow-up Initiative in Germany, Austria, and Luxembourg. Patients with type 1 diabetes younger than 20 years and diabetes duration of more than 1 year were identified. Propensity score matching and inverse probability of treatment weighting analyses with age, sex, diabetes duration, migration background (defined as place of birth outside of Germany or Austria), body mass index, and glycated hemoglobin as covariates were used to account for relevant confounders. Exposures: Type 1 diabetes treated with insulin pump therapy or with multiple (>/=4) daily insulin injections. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes were rates of severe hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis during the most recent treatment year. Secondary outcomes included glycated hemoglobin levels, insulin dose, and body mass index. Results: Of 30579 patients (mean age, 14.1 years [SD, 4.0]; 53% male), 14119 used pump therapy (median duration, 3.7 years) and 16460 used insulin injections (median duration, 3.6 years). Patients using pump therapy (n = 9814) were matched with 9814 patients using injection therapy. Pump therapy, compared with injection therapy, was associated with lower rates of severe hypoglycemia (9.55 vs 13.97 per 100 patient-years; difference, -4.42 [95% CI, -6.15 to -2.69]; P < .001) and diabetic ketoacidosis (3.64 vs 4.26 per 100 patient-years; difference, -0.63 [95% CI, -1.24 to -0.02]; P = .04). Glycated hemoglobin levels were lower with pump therapy than with injection therapy (8.04% vs 8.22%; difference, -0.18 [95% CI, -0.22 to -0.13], P < .001). Total daily insulin doses were lower for pump therapy compared with injection therapy (0.84 U/kg vs 0.98 U/kg; difference, -0.14 [-0.15 to -0.13], P < .001). There was no significant difference in body mass index between both treatment regimens. Similar results were obtained after propensity score inverse probability of treatment weighting analyses in the entire cohort. Conclusions and Relevance: Among young patients with type 1 diabetes, insulin pump therapy, compared with insulin injection therapy, was associated with lower risks of severe hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis and with better glycemic control during the most recent year of therapy.

Thus, we utilized the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare resource to examine risk factors and novel preexisting medical conditions that may be associated with these cancer types. METHODS: Between 2000 and 2011, 2,092 ICC and 2,981 ECC cases and 323,615 controls were identified using the SEER-Medicare database. Logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease was associated with approximately 3-fold increased risks of ICC (OR = 3.52, 95% CI: 2.87-4.32) and ECC (OR = 2.93, 95% CI: 2.42-3.55).

Several autoimmune/inflammatory conditions, including type 1 diabetes and gout, were associated with increased risks of ICC/ECC. As anticipated, viral hepatitis, alcohol-related disorders, and bile duct conditions were associated with both cancer types. However, thyrotoxicosis and hemochromatosis were associated with an increased risk of ICC but not ECC, but did not remain significantly associated after Bonferroni correction. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, risk factors for ICC and ECC were similar, with the exceptions of thyrotoxicosis and hemochromatosis. Notably, metabolic conditions were associated with both cancer types.

Pharmacists conducted medication reconciliation within 24 h of admission and at hospital discharge. Medication history collected from different sources (patient/family interviews, prescriptions/medical records, contact with community pharmacies/general practitioners/nurses) was compared with admission and discharge prescriptions to detect unintentional discrepancies in medication indicating involuntary medication changes. Medication errors were defined as unintentional medication discrepancies corrected by physicians. Risk factors for medication errors and serious errors (i.e. errors that may cause harm) were assessed using logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 322 medication errors were identified and were mainly omissions. Prevalence of medication errors in Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes was 21.5% and 22.2% respectively at admission, and 9.0% and 12.2% at discharge.

In order to develop a clinically implantable BAP, some key aspects need to be taken into accounts: encapsulation material, capsule design and implantation site. Among them, implant site exerts an important influence on the engraftment, stability and biocompatibility of implanted BAP. Currently, an optimal site for encapsulated islet transplantation may include: sufficient capacity to host large graft volumes, portal drainage, ease of access using safe and reproducible procedure, adequate blood/oxygen supply, minimal immune/inflammatory reaction, pliable for noninvasive imaging and biopsy, and potential of local microenvironment manipulation or bioengineering.

In the current study, we have addressed this question and observed that previous RH during seven consecutive days exacerbated oxidative damage and neuronal death induced by a subsequent episode of SH accompanied by a short period of coma, in the parietal cortex, the striatum and mainly in the hippocampus. These changes correlated with a severe decrease in reduced glutathione content (GSH), and a significant spatial and contextual memory deficit.

Managing T2DM and its associated complications in individual patient consultations poses substantial challenges to physicians due to limited time and resources and lack of access to multidisciplinary teams. Shared medical appointments (SMAs) are consecutive medical consultations provided by a physician in a group setting, where integrated medical care and patient education are delivered in a single session. SMAs allow physicians to deliver the same level of care to multiple patients at the same time, thereby maximizing available resources. However, the effectiveness and practicality of SMAs in the management of T2DM remains unknown. This narrative review summarizes current and emerging evidence regarding the effectiveness of SMAs in improving clinical outcomes in patients with T2DM, as well as whether SMAs are associated with reduced costs and improved diabetes-related behavioral and lifestyle changes. An extensive literature search was conducted on major electronic databases including PubMed and Google Scholar using keywords, including SMAs, group visits, and T2DM to identify all studies of SMAs in patients with T2DM. Studies in type 1 diabetes or mixed or unspecified populations were excluded, as well as studies where SMAs did not involve a physician since these do not meet the classical definition of a SMA. Nineteen studies were identified and are included in this review. Overall, current evidence suggests that SMAs delivered regularly over time may be effective in improving glycemic outcomes, diabetes knowledge, and some diabetes-related behaviors. However, the main limitation of existing studies was the paucity of comparisons with standard care which limits the ability to draw conclusions regarding whether SMAs are superior to standard care in T2DM management. Moreover, the small number of studies and substantial heterogeneity in study designs, populations, and interventions creates difficulties in establishing the practicality and efficiency of SMAs in the clinical care setting. We conclude that there remains a need for larger studies to identify populations who may or may not benefit from the SMA model of care and to clarify the potential benefits and barriers to implementing SMAs into routine diabetes care.","type+1+diabetes"],["[An investigation of ketoacidosis in children with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes].",["Tao N","Wang AP","Sun MY","Zhang HH","Chen YQ"],"Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi. 2017 Oct;19(10):1066-1069.","OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in children with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes.

Human alpha-1 antitrypsin (hAAT) has immune-regulatory, anti-inflammatory, and cytoprotective properties as demonstrated in several disease models including type 1 diabetes, arthritis, lupus, osteoporosis, and stroke. To test the potential anti-inflammaging effect of hAAT, we generated transgenic Drosophila lines expressing hAAT. Surprisingly, the lifespan of hAAT-expressing lines was significantly longer than that of genetically matched controls. To understand the mechanism underlying the anti-aging effect of hAAT, we monitored the expression of aging-associated genes and found that aging-induced expressions of Relish (NF-kB orthologue) and Diptericin were significantly lower in hAAT lines than in control lines. RNA-seq analysis revealed that innate immunity genes regulated by NF-kB were significantly and specifically inhibited in hAAT transgenic Drosophila lines. To confirm this anti-inflammaging effect in human cells, we treated X-ray-induced senescence cells with hAAT and showed that hAAT treatment significantly decreased the expression and maturation of IL-6 and IL-8, two major factors of senescence-associated secretory phenotype. Consistent with results from Drosophila,RNA-seq analysis also showed that hAAT treatment significantly inhibited inflammation related genes and pathways. Together, our results demonstrated that hAAT significantly inhibited inflammaging in both Drosophila and human cell models. As hAAT is a FDA-approved drug with a confirmed safety profile, this novel therapeutic potential may make hAAT a promising candidate to combat aging and aging-related diseases.","type+1+diabetes"],["Exocrine pancreas function decreases during the progression of the beta-cell damaging process in young prediabetic children.",["Kondrashova A","Nurminen N","Lehtonen J","Hyoty M","Toppari J","Ilonen J","Veijola R","Knip M","Hyoty H"],"Pediatr Diabetes. 2017 Oct 17. doi: 10.1111/pedi.12592.","OBJECTIVE: The function of the exocrine pancreas is decreased in patients with type 1 diabetes but it is not known when this defect develops.

It harbours both a plant homeodomain (PHD) and a forkhead-associated domain (FHA) implicated in epigenetic recognition and gene regulation, a phenomenon that has remained unexplored. Here, we show that TCF19 selectively interacts with histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4Me3) through its PHD finger. Knocking down TCF19 under high glucose condition affected many metabolic processes, including gluconeogenesis. We found that TCF19 overexpression represses de novo glucose production in HepG2 cells. The transcriptional repression of key genes, induced by TCF19 coincided with NuRD (nucleosome-remodeling-deacetylase) complex recruitment to the promoters of these genes. TCF19 interacted with chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 4 (CHD4), which is a part of the NuRD complex, in a glucose concentration independent manner. In summary, our results show that TCF19 interacts with an active transcription mark and recruits a co-repressor complex to regulate gluconeogenic gene expression in HepG2 cells.

METHODS: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) was induced in Kunming mice via IP injection of STZ. hUCWJCs were labeled with 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI). Diabetic animals with sustained hyperglycemia for at least 2 weeks were administered 1 x 107 Dil-hUCWJCs via intraperitoneal injection. Insulin, glucagon and PDX-1 were detected by immunofluorescence with confocal microscopy. Serum mouse and human C-peptide was assayed in blood collected via intracardiac puncture. Specific beta-cell differentiation markers and human DNA were assessed using qPCR performed with 200 ng of target DNA. RESULTS: hUCWJCs migrated to the STZ-damaged organs and contributed to lower blood glucose levels in 30% of the treated mice. Confocal microscopy revealed the presence of resident insulin-positive cells in the liver and kidneys. hUCWJC-treated mice with restored hyperglycemia also showed increased serum mouse C-peptide levels. The qPCR results, particularly in the liver, revealed that after transplantation hUCWJCs upregulated genes of endocrine precursors but failed to express endocrine stage markers. Mice with restored hyperglycemia had reduced urinary volume and lacked glomerular hypertrophy, exhibiting a morphology resembling that of normal glomeruli. Moreover, we also verified that one of the possible mechanisms by which hUCWJCs exert immunosuppressive effects is through down-regulation of the cell surface receptor HLA-1. CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed the potential of IP administration of hUCWJCs and the capability of these cells to migrate to damaged tissues and promote insulin secretion from non-pancreatic local cells and to improve renal damage. These findings confer unique therapeutic properties to hUCWJCs, suggesting a promising future in the treatment of diabetes mellitus.","type+1+diabetes"],["Assessment of Beta Cell Mass and Function by AIRmax and IVGTT in High Risk Subjects for Type 1 Diabetes.",["Hao W","Wookwyk A","Beam C","Bahnson T","Palmer JP","Greenbaum CJ"],"J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2017 Oct 12. doi: 10.1210/jc.2017-01713.","Context: There is little information regarding beta cell mass in individuals at early stages of type 1 diabetes (T1D). Objective: To investigate both AIRmax, as a correlate of beta cell mass, and beta cell function by IVGTT in subjects at early stages of T1D. Design/Setting/Participants: Forty subjects were enrolled: (1) low risk group: relatives of patients with T1D with 0-1 antibody (n=21) and (2) high risk group: relatives with > 2 antibodies (n=19). Main Outcome Measure: Acute insulin and C-peptide responses to intravenous glucose (IVGTT) and to arginine at hyperglycemia (AIRmax). Participants underwent two IVGTT and AIRmax procedures on different days. Results: AIRmax was reproducible, well tolerated and correlated to FPIR from IVGTT (r =0.779). The high risk group had greater impaired beta cell function compared to the low risk group, determined both by lower mean FPIR and a greater number of subjects below an established threshold for abnormal function [10 of 19 (52.6%) vs. 4 of 21 (19%)]. There was a heterogeneous AIRmax response in these subjects with low FPIR, ranging from 38 to 250 uU/ml. Conclusions: There is significant variation in insulin secretory reserve as assessed by AIRmax in family members with low beta cell function assessed by FPIR. As AIRmax is a functional measure of beta cell mass, these data suggest heterogeneity in disease pathogenesis in which mass is preserved in relation to function in some individuals. The tolerability and reproducibility of AIRmax suggest it could be a useful stratification measure in clinical trials of disease-modifying therapy.","type+1+diabetes"],["Effect of Metformin on vascular function in children with type 1 diabetes: A 12 month randomized controlled trial.",["Anderson JJA","Couper JJ","Giles LC","Leggett CE","Gent R","Coppin B","Pena AS"],"J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2017 Oct 9. doi: 10.1210/jc.2017-00781.","Context: Children with type 1 diabetes have vascular dysfunction preceding atherosclerosis.

Because T-cell activation is dependent on DC antigen uptake, degradation and presentation, we analysed the efficiency of these functions in splenic and GM-CSF bone marrow derived DC from wild type (WT), Ptpn22-/- or Ptpn22R619W mutant mice. Results indicated no differential ability of DCs to uptake antigen via macropinocytosis or receptor-mediated endocytosis. Antigen degradation and presentation was also equal as was WT T-cell conjugate formation and subsequent T-cell proliferation. Despite the likely presence of multiple phosphatase-regulated pathways in the antigen uptake, processing and presentation pathways that we investigated, we observed that Ptpn22 and the R619W autoimmune associated variant were dispensable. These important findings indicate that under non-inflammatory conditions there is no requirement for Ptpn22 in DC dependent antigen uptake and T-cell activation.

After obtaining permission to adapt the Transition Readiness Assessment Questionaire, Turkish Transition Readiness Assessment Questionaire and \"self care scale\" were applied to participants through face to face interviews in two pediatric endocrinology clinics. Validity was evaluated by exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis and content-scope validity; reliability was evaluated by item-total score correlation and continuity methods. Internal reliability was assessed by Cronbach's alpha and criterion validity. RESULTS: The item analysis, Explatory Factor Analysis and Confirmatory Factor Analysis identified 5 basic dimensions with high internal consistency (0.89 to 0.75). x2/df and the other conformity indices were good fit to the data. The correlation coefficient in the analyses of test-retest scores was .86 for the total scale (p<0.05) and the Cronbach\"s alpha coefficient was found as 0.88 for overall scale. CONCLUSION: The Turkish version of Transition Readiness Assessment Questionaire is a valid and reliable measure of transition readiness of adolescents/young adults with diabetes in Turkey.

METHODS: Twenty time series of 8-hour postprandial periods (PP) for a same 60g-carbohydrate meal were collected from a closed-loop controller validation study. A single concatenated time series was produced representing a collection of data from similar scenarios, resulting in seasonality. Variability in the resulting time series was representative of worst-case intrasubject variability. Following a leave-one-out cross-validation, seasonal and nonseasonal autoregressive integrated moving average models (SARIMA and ARIMA) were built to analyze the effect of seasonality in the model prediction accuracy. Further improvement achieved from the inclusion of insulin infusion rate as exogenous variable was also analyzed. Prediction horizons (PHs) from 30 to 300 min were considered. RESULTS: SARIMA outperformed ARIMA revealing a significant role of seasonality. For a 5-h PH, average MAPE was reduced in 26.62%.

This understanding informs the new staging paradigm for type 1 diabetes, which suggests that type 1 diabetes may be recognized and diagnosed long before symptoms develop. Although it is known that nearly all individuals with established islet autoimmunity will eventually develop symptomatic type 1 diabetes (T1D), individual characteristics such as age and biomarker profile may predict rate of disease progression and response to treatment and may therefore be used to individualize therapy. Key research supports the use of immunotherapy in TID, although a paradigm shift is necessary before immunotherapy may transition from clinical trials to clinical practice.

The coupling between arterial stiffness and myocardial function is still unresolved. We investigate associations between arterial stiffness and early myocardial impairment assessed with advanced echocardiography. METHODS: In 305 type 1 diabetes (T1D) patients without known heart disease and with normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (biplane LVEF > 45%), we measured arterial stiffness as pulse wave velocity (PWV) and performed conventional and speckle-tracking echocardiography assessing global longitudinal strain (GLS) as a measure of systolic myocardial function. Associations between PWV and myocardial function were reported as standardized beta values from adjusted regression models including age, sex, mean arterial pressure, body mass index, HbA1c, diabetes duration, estimated glomerular filtration rate, degree of albuminuria, total cholesterol, heart rate and smoking. RESULTS: Patients were 54 (12) years [mean (SD)], 152 (50%) females, diabetes duration 31 (16) years, HbA1c 65 (12) mmol/mol, LVEF 58 (5) %, GLS -18.2 (2.6) % and PWV 10.2 (3.4) m/s. There was no association between PWV and LVEF (p = 0.93). Conversely, there was a highly significant association between PWV and GLS in crude and multivariable models (standardized beta-coefficient 0.25, p < 0.001 and 0.16, p = 0.036, respectively). Also, diastolic function measured as E/e' was highly associated with PWV in crude and multivariable models (standardized beta-coefficient 0.43, p < 0.001 and 0.17, p = 0.016, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In T1D patients with normal LVEF and without known heart disease, higher arterial stiffness is independently associated with early systolic and diastolic myocardial impairment detectable by advanced echocardiography.

It is characterized by the destruction of pancreatic beta cells by the immune system, which leads to lifelong dependency on exogenous insulin and imposes an enormous burden on patients and health-care resources. T1DM is also associated with an increased risk of comorbidities, such as cardiovascular disease, retinopathy, and diabetic kidney disease (DKD), further contributing to the burden of this disease. Although T cells are largely considered to be responsible for beta-cell destruction in T1DM, increasing evidence points towards a role for B cells in disease pathogenesis. B cell-depletion, for example, delays disease progression in patients with newly diagnosed T1DM. Loss of tolerance of islet antigen-reactive B cells occurs early in disease and numbers of pancreatic CD20+ B cells correlate with beta-cell loss. Although the importance of B cells in T1DM is increasingly apparent, exactly how these cells contribute to disease and its comorbidities, such as DKD, is not well understood. Here we discuss the role of B cells in the pathogenesis of T1DM and how these cells are activated during disease development.

METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis of admissions for DKA in YWD aged 15-25, presenting to four hospitals in Western Sydney in 2011 was performed. Number of admissions, length of stay (LOS) and DKA severity were assessed. Cost was analysed as a function of LOS. Groups were divided by attendance at a youth-specific diabetes service or no record of attendance. RESULTS: There were 55 DKA admissions from 39 patients (median age 20.0 years); the majority of admissions (82%) were YWD not supported by a youth-specific diabetes service. Median LOS was significantly longer in the unsupported group (3.0 days vs. 1.5 days, p=0.028). Median pH at presentation in the unsupported group was significantly lower, 7.11 versus 7.23 (p=0.05). There was a 4-fold greater admission rate in those not supported by youth-specific diabetes services, 5.5% compared with 1.6% (p=0.001). The estimated cost saved by youth-specific services was over $250,000pa. CONCLUSIONS: Lack of access to supported care for YWD at the transition has an adverse impact on DKA admission rates and LOS.","type+1+diabetes"],["[High-dose heat shock protein gp96 immunization prevents type 1 diabetes via inducing regulatory T cells].",["Chen M","Li X","Zheng H","Meng S"],"Sheng Wu Gong Cheng Xue Bao. 2016 Dec 25;32(12):1685-1693. doi: 10.13345/j.cjb.160071.","Type 1 diabetes (T1D), the most prevalent human autoimmune disease, occurs in genetically susceptible individuals.

Acute-onset type 1 diabetes would be equivalent to type 1A diabetes, the typical type 1 diabetes in Western countries. The insulin secretion capacity in Japanese subjects with long-standing type 1A diabetes is unclear. The aim of this study is to clarify the course of endogenous insulin secretion during long-term follow-up and factors associated with residual insulin secretion in patients with acute-onset type 1 diabetes (autoimmune). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively investigated endogenous insulin secretion capacity in 71 patients who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for acute-onset type 1 diabetes (autoimmune) in Japan. To assess the residual insulin secretion capacity, we evaluated randomly measured C-peptide levels and results of glucagon stimulation test in 71 patients. RESULTS: In the first year of disease, the child- and adolescent-onset patients had significantly more in residual insulin secretion than the adult-onset patients (34 patients in total). C-peptide levels declined more rapidly in patients whose onset were younger than 18 years old have than in patients whose onset were older than 19 years old. Endogenous insulin secretion capacity stimulated by glucagon was completely lost in almost all patients at more than 15 years after onset (61 patients in total). CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with acute-onset type 1 diabetes (autoimmune) completely lose their endogenous insulin secretion capacity during the disease duration in Japan.

In this review, nutritional approaches during early life in order to protect against T1D development have been discussed. The critical role of tolerogenic dendritic cells in central and peripheral tolerance has been emphasized. In addition, since the gut microbiota affects the development of T1D through short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-dependent mechanisms, we hypothesize that nutritional intervention boosting SCFA production may be used as a novel prevention strategy. Current retrospective evidence has suggested that exclusive and prolonged breastfeeding might play a protective role against the development of T1D. The beneficial properties of human milk are possibly attributed to its bioactive components such as unique immune-modulatory components human milk oligosaccharides and metabolites derived thereof, including SCFAs.

There are many beta cell proteins that are targeted by autoreactive T cells in their native state. However, recent studies have demonstrated that many beta cell proteins are recognized as neo-antigens following posttranslational modification (PTM). Although modified neo-antigens are well-established targets of pathology in other autoimmune diseases, the effects of neo-antigens in T1D progression and the mechanisms by which they are generated are not well understood. We have demonstrated that PTM occurs during endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, a process to which beta cells are uniquely susceptible due to the high rate of insulin production in response to dynamic glucose sensing. In the context of genetic susceptibility to autoimmunity, presentation of these modified neo-antigens may activate autoreactive T cells and cause pathology. However, inherent beta cell ER stress and protein PTM do not cause T1D in every genetically susceptible individual, suggesting the contribution of additional factors. Indeed, many environmental factors, such as viral infection, chemicals, or inflammatory cytokines, are associated with T1D onset, but the mechanisms by which these factors lead to disease onset remain unknown. Since these environmental factors also cause ER stress, exposure to these factors may enhance production of neo-antigens, therefore boosting beta cell recognition by autoreactive T cells and exacerbating T1D pathogenesis. Therefore, the combined effects of physiological ER stress and the stress that is induced by environmental factors may lead to breaks in peripheral tolerance, contribute to antigen spread, and hasten disease onset. This Hypothesis and Theory article summarizes what is currently known about ER stress and protein PTM in autoimmune diseases including T1D and proposes a role for environmental factors in breaking immune tolerance to beta cell antigens through neo-antigen formation.","type+1+diabetes"],["A Personalized Week-to-Week Updating Algorithm to Improve Continuous Glucose Monitoring Performance.",["Zavitsanou S","Lee JB","Pinsker JE","Church MM","Doyle FJ 3rd","Dassau E"],"J Diabetes Sci Technol. 2017 Oct 1:1932296817734367. doi: 10.1177/1932296817734367.","BACKGROUND: Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems are increasingly becoming essential components in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) management. Current CGM technology requires frequent calibration to ensure accurate sensor performance. The accuracy of these systems is of great importance since medical decisions are made based on monitored glucose values and trends. METHODS: In this work, we introduce a calibration strategy that is augmented with a weekly updating feature. During the life cycle of the sensor, the calibration mechanism periodically estimates the parameters of a calibration model to fit self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) measurements. At the end of each week of use, an optimization problem that minimizes the sum of squared residuals between past reference and predicted blood glucose values is solved remotely to identify personalized calibration parameters. The newly identified parameters are used to initialize the calibration mechanism of the following week. RESULTS: The proposed method was evaluated using two sets of clinical data both consisting of 6 weeks of Dexcom G4 Platinum CGM data on 10 adults with T1DM (over 10 000 hours of CGM use), with seven SMBG data points per day measured by each subject in an unsupervised outpatient setting. Updating the calibration parameters using the history of calibration data indicated a positive trend of improving CGM performance. CONCLUSIONS: Although not statistically significant, the updating framework showed a relative improvement of CGM accuracy compared to the non-updating, static calibration method. The use of information collected for longer periods is expected to improve the performance of the sensor over time.","type+1+diabetes"],["The effects of add-on exenatide to insulin on glycemic variability and hypoglycemia in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.",["Jiang LL","Wang SQ","Ding B","Zhu J","Jing T","Ye L","Lee KO","Wu JD","Ma JH"],"J Endocrinol Invest. 2017 Oct 14. doi: 10.1007/s40618-017-0765-0.","OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of add-on exenatide to insulin on glycemic excursion and the counter-regulatory hormone in response to hypoglycemia in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). METHODS: 30 patients with T1DM were recruited and randomly assigned to exenatide + insulin-treated group (group 1, n = 15) or insulin-only-treated group (group 2, n = 15) for 4 weeks. All patients had continuous glucose monitor system (CGMS) applied at before (week-0) and after (week-4) treatment to evaluate the glycemic variability. All patients had an arginine-stimulated test at before and after treatment. Six patients from each group also had hypoglycemic clamp test to assess counter-regulatory hormone level. RESULTS: Patients in the exenatide group had significant reductions in body weight, body mass index (BMI), total insulin dose, bolus insulin dose, fructosamine, and glycemic excursion after 4 weeks' treatment. Compared with patients in group 2, the mean amplitude of glycemic excursion (MAGE) and coefficient of variation (CV) of exenatide group decreased significantly. Similarly, a significant decrease of glucagon (GLC) in the arginine-stimulated test was found in group 1.

Lipid nanoparticle (LNP) delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) effectively targets the liver and is in clinical trials for the treatment of various diseases. We compared the effectiveness of glucagon receptor (Gcgr)-siRNA delivered via LNPs to leptin in two mouse models of diabetes. METHODS: Gcgr siRNA encapsulated into LNPs or leptin was administered to mice with diabetes due to injection of the beta-cell toxin streptozotocin (STZ) alone or combined with high fat diet (HFD/STZ). RESULTS: In STZ-diabetic mice, a single injection of Gcgr siRNA lowered blood glucose levels for 3 weeks, improved glucose tolerance, and normalized plasma ketones levels, while leptin therapy normalized blood glucose levels, oral glucose tolerance, and plasma ketones, and suppressed lipid metabolism. In contrast, in HFD/STZ-diabetic mice, Gcgr siRNA lowered blood glucose levels for 2 months, improved oral glucose tolerance, and reduced HbA1c, while leptin had no beneficial effects.

We hypothesised that the combination of an orally active pan-histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi: givinostat) with subtherapeutic doses of CD3 antibodies may provide ideal synergy to treat ongoing autoimmunity. METHODS: NOD mice transgenic for the human CD3epsilon (also known as CD3E) chain (NOD-huCD3epsilon) were treated for recent-onset diabetes with oral givinostat, subtherapeutic doses of humanised CD3 antibodies (otelixizumab, 50 mug/day, 5 days, i.v.) or a combination of both drugs. Disease remission, metabolic profiles and autoreactive T cell responses were analysed in treated mice. RESULTS: We demonstrated that givinostat synergised with otelixizumab to induce durable remission of diabetes in 80% of recently diabetic NOD-huCD3epsilon mice. Remission was obtained in only 47% of mice treated with otelixizumab alone. Oral givinostat monotherapy did not reverse established diabetes but reduced the in situ production of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha). Importantly, the otelixizumab + givinostat combination strongly improved the metabolic status of NOD-huCD3epsilon mice; the mice recovered the capacity to appropriately produce insulin, control hyperglycaemia and sustain glucose tolerance. Finally, diabetes remission induced by the combination therapy was associated with a significant reduction of insulitis and autoantigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: HDACi and low-dose CD3 antibodies synergised to abrogate in situ inflammation and thereby improved pancreatic beta cell survival and metabolic function leading to long-lasting diabetes remission.

The study subjects were subdivided into a rapid progression group with C-peptide levels <0.6 ng/mL at 36 months (n=27; Group A) and a slow progression group with C-peptide levels >0.6 ng/mL at 36 months (n=7; Group B). Patients in Group A had a younger mean age at diagnosis (A: 9+/-4.3 years vs. B: 13.6+/-3.6 years; p=0.013) and lower body mass index (BMI) (A: 15.5+/-2.5 kg/m2 vs. B: 18.7+/-3.3 kg/m2; p=0.035). There were fewer asymptomatic patients with glucosuria in Group A, with these patients showing more severe symptoms, such as diabetic ketoacidosis (p=0.035), than those in Group B. Group A also had lower initial C-peptide levels (A: 0.5+/-0.46 ng/mL vs. B: 1.87+/-1.08 ng/mL; p=0.001). There were no significant intergroup differences in sex, family history, baseline hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), potential of hydrogen (pH), autoantibodies or serum insulin. Simple correlation analyses showed that C-peptide levels were correlated with age and BMI, but not with pH, insulin, or HbA1c. Younger patients, who had a lower BMI, significant symptoms with complications, and/or a low initial C-peptide level, tended to show a rapid rate of decrease in C-peptide levels. Early intensive insulin therapy to preserve beta-cell function should be considered in these groups.","type+1+diabetes"],["Ketosis-prone diabetes and SLE co-presenting in an African lady with previous gestational diabetes.",["Hussain S","Keat S","Gelding SV"],"Endocrinol Diabetes Metab Case Rep. 2017 Oct 6;2017. pii: 17-0086. doi: 10.1530/EDM-17-0086. eCollection 2017.","We describe the case of an African woman who was diagnosed with ketosis-prone diabetes with diabetes-associated autoantibodies, after being admitted for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) precipitated by her first presentation of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). She had a seven-year history of recurrent gestational diabetes (GDM) not requiring insulin therapy, with return to normoglycaemia after each pregnancy. This might have suggested that she had now developed type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, the diagnosis of SLE prompted testing for an autoimmune aetiology for the diabetes, and she was found to have a very high titre of GAD antibodies. Typical type 1 diabetes (T1D) was thought unlikely due to the long preceding history of GDM. Latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA) was considered, but ruled out as she required insulin therapy from diagnosis. The challenge of identifying the type of diabetes when clinical features overlap the various diabetes categories is discussed. This is the first report of autoimmune ketosis-prone diabetes (KPD) presenting with new onset of SLE. LEARNING POINTS: DKA may be the first presentation of a multi-system condition and a precipitating cause should always be sought, particularly in women with a history of GDM or suspected T2D.All women with GDM should undergo repeat glucose tolerance testing postpartum to exclude frank diabetes, even when post-delivery capillary blood glucose (CBG) tests are normal. They should also be advised to continue CBG monitoring during acute illness in case of new onset diabetes.KPD comprises a spectrum of diabetes syndromes that present with DKA, but subsequently have a variable course depending on the presence or absence of beta cell failure and/or diabetes autoantibodies.KPD should be considered in a patient with presumed T2D presenting with DKA, especially if there is a personal or family history of autoimmune diabetes.LADA should be suspected in adults presumed to have T2D, who do not require insulin therapy for at least six months after diagnosis and have anti-GAD antibodies.Patients with autoimmune diabetes have an increased risk of other autoimmune diseases and screening for thyroid, parietal cell, coeliac and antinuclear antibodies should be considered.","type+1+diabetes"],["Camel Milk Has Beneficial Effects on Diabetes Mellitus: A Systematic Review.",["Mirmiran P","Ejtahed HS","Angoorani P","Eslami F","Azizi F"],"Int J Endocrinol Metab. 2017 Mar 11;15(2):e42150. doi: 10.5812/ijem.42150. eCollection 2017 Apr.","CONTEXT: Controlling diabetes, a worldwide metabolic disease, by effective alternative treatments is currently a topic of great interest. Camel milk is believed to be a suitable hypoglycemic agent in experimental animals and patients with diabetes. The current systematic review aimed at evaluating the effect of camel milk on diabetes. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A comprehensive search was dine in PubMed and Scopus for all clinical trials and animal studies documented up to 2015, which focused on the effect of camel milk on diabetes markers. Studies which assessed the effects of camel milk, with no dose limit, on glucose parameters and lipid profiles in animals or humans with diabetes, were included. The quality of the included clinical trials was evaluated by the Delphi score checklist. RESULTS: The initial search yielded 73 articles. After screening abstracts and full texts, 22 articles were included consisting of 11 animal studies and 11 clinical trials, 8 of which focused on type 1 diabetes and the other three on type 2diabetes. All animal studies except for 1 showed significant reductions in at least 1 of the diabetes parameters such as blood glucose, insulin resistance, glycated hemoglobin, and lipid profile. In most of the clinical trials, the recommended dose of camel milk was 500 mL/day, which led to improvement of diabetes markers even after 3 months in patients with diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the studies in the current systematic review demonstrated the favorable effects of camel milk on diabetes mellitus by reducing blood sugar, decreasing insulin resistance and improving lipid profiles.","type+1+diabetes"],["Heartbeat: Glycaemic control and excess risk of major coronary events in type 1 diabetes.",["Rahimi K","Otto CM"],"Heart. 2017 Nov;103(21):1653-1655. doi: 10.1136/heartjnl-2017-312470.","","type+1+diabetes"],["Disease-specific biases in alternative splicing and tissue-specific dysregulation revealed by multitissue profiling of lymphocyte gene expression in type 1 diabetes.",["Newman JRB","Conesa A","Mika M","New FN","Onengut-Gumuscu S","Atkinson MA","Rich SS","McIntyre LM","Concannon P"],"Genome Res. 2017 Oct 12. doi: 10.1101/gr.217984.116.","Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified multiple, shared allelic associations with many autoimmune diseases. However, the pathogenic contributions of variants residing in risk loci remain unresolved. The location of the majority of shared disease-associated variants in noncoding regions suggests they contribute to risk of autoimmunity through effects on gene expression in the immune system. In the current study, we test this hypothesis by applying RNA sequencing to CD4+, CD8+, and CD19+ lymphocyte populations isolated from 81 subjects with type 1 diabetes (T1D). We characterize and compare the expression patterns across these cell types for three gene sets: all genes, the set of genes implicated in autoimmune disease risk by GWAS, and the subset of these genes specifically implicated in T1D. We performed RNA sequencing and aligned the reads to both the human reference genome and a catalog of all possible splicing events developed from the genome, thereby providing a comprehensive evaluation of the roles of gene expression and alternative splicing (AS) in autoimmunity. Autoimmune candidate genes displayed greater expression specificity in the three lymphocyte populations relative to other genes, with significantly increased levels of splicing events, particularly those predicted to have substantial effects on protein isoform structure and function (e.g., intron retention, exon skipping). The majority of single-nucleotide polymorphisms within T1D-associated loci were also associated with one or more cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTLs) and/or splicing eQTLs. Our findings highlight a substantial, and previously underrecognized, role for AS in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders and particularly for T1D.","type+1+diabetes"],["TCF7L2 Genetic Variants Contribute to Phenotypic Heterogeneity of Type 1 Diabetes.",["Redondo MJ","Geyer S","Steck AK","Sosenko J","Anderson M","Antinozzi P","Michels A","Wentworth J","Xu P","Pugliese A"],"Diabetes Care. 2017 Oct 12. pii: dc170961. doi: 10.2337/dc17-0961.","OBJECTIVE: The phenotypic diversity of type 1 diabetes suggests heterogeneous etiopathogenesis. We investigated the relationship of type 2 diabetes-associated transcription factor 7 like 2 (TCF7L2) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) with immunologic and metabolic characteristics at type 1 diabetes diagnosis. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied TrialNet participants with newly diagnosed autoimmune type 1 diabetes with available TCF7L2 rs4506565 and rs7901695 SNP data (n = 810; median age 13.6 years; range 3.3-58.6). We modeled the influence of carrying a TCF7L2 variant (i.e., having 1 or 2 minor alleles) on the number of islet autoantibodies and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)-stimulated C-peptide and glucose measures at diabetes diagnosis. All analyses were adjusted for known confounders. RESULTS: The rs4506565 variant was a significant independent factor of expressing a single autoantibody, instead of multiple autoantibodies, at diagnosis (odds ratio [OR] 1.66 [95% CI 1.07, 2.57], P = 0.024).

The results were similar for the rs7901695 SNP. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of individuals with new-onset type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes-linked TCF7L2 variants were associated with single autoantibody (among those >/=12 years old), higher C-peptide AUC, and lower glucose AUC levels during an OGTT. Thus, carriers of the TCF7L2 variant had a milder immunological and metabolic phenotype at type 1 diabetes diagnosis, which could be partly driven by type 2 diabetes-like pathogenic mechanisms.","type+1+diabetes"],["Low Incidence of End-Stage Renal Disease in Childhood-Onset Type 1 Diabetes Followed for Up to 42 Years.",["Gagnum V","Saeed M","Stene LC","Leivestad T","Joner G","Skrivarhaug T"],"Diabetes Care. 2017 Oct 12. pii: dc170906. doi: 10.2337/dc17-0906.","OBJECTIVE: End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is one of the most severe complications in type 1 diabetes.

Follow-up took place until the development of ESRD, death, emigration, or 30 November 2015. We estimated the cumulative incidence of ESRD by linking to the Norwegian Renal Registry. RESULTS: Among the 7,871 patients, representing 147,714 person-years of follow-up, ESRD developed in 103 individuals (1.3%). The mean time from the diagnosis of diabetes to the development of ESRD was 25.9 years (range 12.7-39.1). The cumulative incidence of ESRD was 0.7% (95% CI 0.4-1.0) at 20 years diabetes duration, 2.9% (2.3-3.7) at 30 years duration, and 5.3% (4.3-6.5) at 40 years duration. The risk of the development of ESRD was lower in women than in men (hazard ratio [HR] 0.61; 95% CI 0.41-0.91) and higher in individuals in whom diabetes had been diagnosed at 10-14 years of age compared with those in whom it was diagnosed before 10 years of age (HR 1.29; 1.06-1.56).

We identify and extract all patients with type 2 diabetes and associated clinical data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) to inform models of disease progression and stratification of treatment. PARTICIPANTS: Data were extracted from CPRD on 8 August 2016. The initial data set contained all patients (n=313 485) in the database who had received a type 2 diabetes medication. Criteria were applied to identify and exclude those with type 1 diabetes, polycystic ovarian syndrome or other forms of diabetes (n=40 204), and for data quality control (n=12). We identified 251 338 patients for inclusion in future analyses of diabetes progression and treatment response. FINDINGS TO DATE: For 6-month response to treatment, measured by change in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), we have 91 765 patients with 119 785 treatment response episodes. The greatest impact on reduction of HbA1c occurs with first-line and second-line treatments, metformin and sulfonylurea. Patients moving to third-line treatments tend to have greater weights and higher body mass index. We have investigated the impact of non-adherence to commonly used glucose-lowering medications on HbA1c. For baseline-adjusted HbA1c change over 1 year, non-adherent patients had lower HbA1c reductions than adherent patients, with mean and 95% CI of -4.4 (-4.7 to -4.0) mmol/mol (-0.40 (-0.43 to -0.37) %). FUTURE PLANS: Findings from studies using these data will help inform future treatment plans and guidelines. Additional data are added with updates from CPRD. This will increase the numbers of patients on newer medications and add more data on those already receiving treatment. There are several ongoing studies investigating different hypotheses regarding differential response to treatment and progression of diabetes. For side effects, links to Hospital Episode Statistics data, where severe events such as hypoglycaemia will be recorded, will also be explored.","type+1+diabetes"],["Effects of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12 on beta-cell function in children with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes: protocol of a randomised controlled trial.",["Groele L","Szajewska H","Szypowska A"],"BMJ Open. 2017 Oct 11;7(10):e017178. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2017-017178.","INTRODUCTION: Recent evidence has demonstrated that, among other factors, dysbiosis (imbalances in the composition and function of the gut microbiota) may be relevant in the development of type 1 diabetes (T1D).

Since so little is known about work life of individuals with type 1 diabetes, we examined incidence and prevalence trends of type 1 diabetes among working-aged Finns. We also investigated the employment rate and how workers with type 1 diabetes perceive their health and work ability, and their intended retirement age. METHODS: We analyzed changes in the incidence, prevalence, and employment rate using nationwide multi-register-based FinDM data, and estimated a Self-Rated Health, Work Ability Score, and inquired about retirement intentions of 767 working individuals with type 1 diabetes in a cross-sectional survey. All estimates were compared to the corresponding data of the Finnish general population. RESULTS: The average annual age-standardized incidence rate of type 1 diabetes among men aged 18-39 was 29 per 100,000/year; the incidence rate has increased by 33% from 1992 to 2007. Among women, the incidence remained at 16 per 100,000/year. Among working-aged (18-64) people, the age-standardized prevalence of type 1 diabetes increased by 39% among women and 33% among men. Two out of every three working aged individuals with type 1 diabetes were in the labor force; this is about 10% lower than in the Finnish population. The average age-standardized employment rate among those individuals with type 1 diabetes belonging to the labor force was 82%, compared to 84% in the general population. Working individuals with type 1 diabetes rated their health and work ability as being slightly lower than the general working population, but nonetheless, there were no significant differences in retirement intentions. CONCLUSIONS: Between 1992 and 2007, the number of working-aged people and workers with type 1 diabetes increased by 35%. Most workers with type 1 diabetes manage as well at work as the general population.

However, these manuals are lengthy and difficult to use, particularly in emergencies. We aim to assess the impact of targeted education on warnings and errors in improving competency to troubleshoot the alarms. METHODS: Twenty-one patients, with a median age of 13, were recruited over a 5-month period. Each patient had 2 study visits. The frequencies and types of alarms were recorded, and patients were given a summary sheet that outlined common alarms encountered and troubleshooting tips. In visit 2, the frequencies and types of alarms were compared to those of visit 1. The patients were asked to fill a questionnaire and to rate the education session given in visit 1, their level of competency in decrypting alarm codes, and their promptness in responding to alarms. RESULTS: Low cartridge (W1), low battery (W2), and bolus cancelled (W8) were the commonest warnings. The most noted errors were occlusion (E4), power interruption (E8), empty battery (E2), set not primed (E11), and cartridge empty (E1).

T1D requires injections of insulin, self-management of blood testing, regular physical activity, and diet monitoring, which are challenging for growing and developing adolescents. Adolescents are often more concerned with how they are perceived by their peers than how they perceive themselves. Positive peer responses influence the self-care management of adolescents with T1D in school settings. By contrast, negative peer responses and avoidance behaviors threaten to negatively affect the health outcomes of adolescents with T1D. Evidence indicates that peer influence is crucial to the successful self-management of diabetes in adolescents. However, very few studies have investigated the effect of peer influence on adolescents with T1D. PURPOSE: This article describes how adolescents with T1D perceive the responses of their peers to their diabetes self-management in school settings. METHODS: Ten 12- to 17-year-old adolescents with diabetes were recruited from a pediatric endocrinology clinic at a university hospital in Taiwan. Audio-recorded interview data were transcribed verbatim and reviewed for accuracy. A thematic analysis approach was used to analyze the narrative content of semistructured interviews with participants. The rigor of the data collection and analysis was emphasized. RESULTS: Analysis of peer responses to the diabetes care practices of the participants revealed six themes: knowledge seeking, curiosity, enthusiasm, empathy, fearfulness, and isolation and bullying. Subthemes were categorized to illustrate how adolescents with T1D balance the challenge of diabetes self-care regimens and normal peer interactions. They were coping with the requirements of their T1D regimen and hoping to determine the perceptions of their peers toward this regimen and themselves. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Understanding the perception of peer identity for adolescents with T1D provides information for diabetes education and assists school nurses to facilitate successful T1D management in adolescents.","type+1+diabetes"],["Levels of Blood Glucose and Insulin Expression of Beta-cells in Streptozotocin-induced Diabetic Rats Treated with Ethanolic Extract of Artocarpus altilis Leaves and GABA.",["Indrowati M","Pratiwi R","Rumiyati","Astuti P"],"Pak J Biol Sci. 2017;20(1):28-35. doi: 10.3923/pjbs.2017.28.35.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Information about the Artocarpus altilis leaf as an antidiabetic associated with the active compounds Gamma Amino Butyric Acid (GABA) is still limited.

Three hundred and eighty-two serum specimens of children with T1D, one hundred serum specimens of children who did not suffer from T1D as control, and forty-eight water and sewage samples were screened for EV RNA using nested RT-PCR. The number of genome copies and infectious units of EVs in raw and treated sewage and water samples were investigated using real-time (RT)-PCR and plaque assay, respectively. T1D markers [Fasting blood glucose (FBG), HbA1c, and C-peptide], in addition to anti-Coxsackie A & B viruses (CVs A & B) IgG, were measured in control, T1D-negative EV (T1D-EV-), and T1D-positive EV (T1D-EV+) children specimens. The prevalence of EV genome was significantly higher in diabetic children (26.2%, 100 out of 382) than the control children (0%, 0 out of 100). FBG and HbA1c in T1D-EV- and T1D-EV+ children specimens were significantly higher than those in the control group, while c-peptide in T1D-EV- and T1D-EV+ children specimens was significantly lower than that in the control (n = 100; p < 0.001). Positivity of anti-CVs A & B IgG was 70.7, 6.7, and 22.9% in T1D-EV+, T1D-EV-, and control children specimens, respectively. The prevalence of EV genome in drinking water and treated sewage samples was 25 and 33.3%, respectively. The prevalence of EV infectious units in drinking water and treated sewage samples was 8.5 and 25%, respectively. Quantification assays were performed to assess the capabilities of both wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and water treatment plants (WTPs) to remove EV. The reduction of EV genome in Zenin WWTP ranged from 2 to 4 log10, while the reduction of EV infectious units ranged from 1 to 4 log10. The reduction of EV genome in El-Giza WTP ranged from 1 to 3 log10, while the reduction of EV infectious units ranged from 1 to 2 log10. This capability of reduction did not prevent the appearance of infectious EV in treated sewage and drinking water. Plaque purification was performed for isolation of separate EV isolates from treated and untreated water and sewage samples. Characterization of the EV amplicons by RT-PCR followed by sequencing of these isolates revealed high homology (97%) with human coxsackievirus B4 (CV B4) in 60% of the isolates, while the rest of the isolates belonged to poliovirus type 1 and type 2 vaccine strains. On the other hand, characterization of the EV amplicons by RT-PCR followed by sequencing for T1D-EV+ children specimens indicated that all samples contained CV B4 with the same sequence characterized in the environmental samples.

Immunosequencing of TCR alpha/beta-chain complementarity determining regions, along with transcriptional profiling, offers the potential to transform biomarker discovery. Herein, we review recent studies characterizing the autoreactive TCR signature in T1D, emerging technologies, and the challenges and opportunities associated with tracking TCR molecular profiles during the natural history of T1D.","type+1+diabetes"],["Managing diabetes at high altitude: personal experience with support from a Multidisciplinary Physical Activity and Diabetes Clinic.",["Malcolm G","Rilstone S","Sivasubramaniyam S","Jairam C","Chew S","Oliver N","Hill NE"],"BMJ Open Sport Exerc Med. 2017 Aug 16;3(1):e000238. doi: 10.1136/bmjsem-2017-000238. eCollection 2017.","OBJECTIVE: Physical activity is important for well-being but can be challenging for people with diabetes. Data informing support of specialist activities such as climbing and high-altitude trekking are limited. A 42-year-old man with type 1 diabetes (duration 30 years) attended a Multidisciplinary Physical Activity and Diabetes Clinic planning to climb Mont Blanc during the summer and trek to Everest Base Camp in the autumn. His aims were to complete these adventures without his diabetes impacting on their success. METHODS: We report the information provided that enabled him to safely facilitate his objectives, in particular, the requirement for frequent checking of blood glucose levels, the effects of altitude on insulin dose requirements, and recognition that acute mountain sickness may mimic the symptoms of hypoglycaemia and vice versa. Real-time continuous glucose monitoring was made available for his treks. RESULTS: The effects of high altitude on blood glucose results and glycaemic variability while treated on multiple daily injections of insulin are reported. In addition, we present a first-person account of his experience and lessons learnt from managing diabetes at high altitude. CONCLUSIONS: A dedicated Multidisciplinary Physical Activity and Diabetes Clinic delivering individualised, evidence-based, patient-focused advice on the effects of altitude on blood glucose levels, and provision of real-time continuous glucose monitoring enabled uneventful completion of a trek to Everest Base Camp in a person with type 1 diabetes.","type+1+diabetes"],["Vaccination and autoimmune diseases: is prevention of adverse health effects on the horizon?",["Vadala M","Poddighe D","Laurino C","Palmieri B"],"EPMA J. 2017 Jul 20;8(3):295-311. doi: 10.1007/s13167-017-0101-y. eCollection 2017 Sep.","Autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis and type 1 diabetes mellitus, affect about 5% of the worldwide population.

We sought to examine the social disparities in the population prevalence of diabetes and in the development of treated end stage renal disease due to type 1 diabetes which has not previously been studied in Australia and New Zealand in isolation from type 2 diabetes. METHODS: This observational study examined the population prevalence of diabetes in a sample of the Australian population (7,434,492) using data from the National Diabetes Services Scheme and of treated end stage renal disease due to diabetes using data from the Australian and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry. The data were then correlated with the Australian Bureau of Statistics Socioeconomic Indexes for Areas for an examination of socioeconomic disparities. RESULTS: There is a social gradient in the prevalence of diabetes in Australia with disease incidence decreasing incrementally with increasing affluence (Spearman's rho = .765 p < 0.001). There is a higher risk of developing end stage renal disease due to type 1 diabetes for males with low socioeconomic status (RR 1.20; CI 1.002-1.459) in comparison to females with low socioeconomic status. In Australia and New Zealand Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, Maori and Pacific Islanders appear to have a low risk of end stage renal disease due to type 1 diabetes but continue to carry a vastly disproportionate burden of end stage renal disease due to type 2 diabetes (RR 6.57 CI 6.04-7.14 & 6.48 CI 6.02-6.97 respectively p < 0.001) in comparison to other Australian and New Zealanders. CONCLUSION: Whilst low socioeconomic status is associated with a higher prevalence of diabetes the inverse social gradient seen in this study has not previously been reported. The social disparity seen in relation to treated end stage renal disease due to type 2 diabetes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, Maori and Pacific Islanders has changed very little in the past 20 years.

AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of leucine supplementation and resistance training (RT) in attenuating WAT loss and improving inflammatory parameters and glucose metabolism in DM1 rats. METHODS: Thirty-two male Wistar rats were distributed into four groups: DA (sedentary and supplemented with non-essential amino acids (NEAA)), DL (sedentary and supplemented with leucine), DTA (submitted to RT and supplemented with NEAA) and DTL (submitted to RT and supplemented with leucine). DM1 was induced by streptozotocin (STZ). An 8-week period of RT consisted of climbing a ladder with a progressively increased load, and supplementation was offered in the feed. RESULTS: Glycemia, polyphagia and polydipsia were lower in DL, DTA and DTL groups compared with the DA group by approximately 20% ( p<.0001), 28% ( p=.004) and 64% ( p<.0001), respectively. Weight of total WAT and retroperitoneal adipose tissue (RPAT) were higher by approximately 21% ( p=.01) and 54% ( p=.0004), respectively, in DL, DTA and DTL groups compared with DA.

Poor insulin adherence may cause severe hypoglycemia (SHO), leading to hospitalization and long-term complications; these, in turn, drive up costs of SHO and T1DM overall. This study's objective was to estimate the prevalence and costs of SHO-related hospitalizations and their additional longer-term impacts on patients with T1DM using basal-bolus insulin. METHODS: Using Truven MarketScan claims, we identified adult T1DM patients using basal-bolus insulin regimens who were hospitalized for SHO (inpatient SHO patients) during 2010-2015. We defined two comparison groups: those with outpatient SHO-related encounters only, including emergency department (ED) visits without hospitalization (outpatient SHO patients), and those with no SHO- or acute hyperglycemia-related events (comparison patients). We estimated lengths of stay and SHO-related hospitalization costs and used propensity score and inverse probability weighting methods to adjust for baseline differences across the groups to evaluate longer-term impacts. RESULTS: We identified 8,734 patients; 4.2% experienced at least one SHO-related hospitalization. Among those who experienced SHO (i.e., of those in the inpatient and outpatient SHO groups), 31% experienced at least one SHO-related hospitalization, while 9% were treated in the ED without subsequent hospitalization. Approximately 79% of patients were admitted directly to the hospital; the remainder were first assessed or treated in the ED. The inpatient SHO patients stayed in the hospital, including time in the ED, for 1.7 days and incurred $3,551 in costs. About one-third of patients were hospitalized again for SHO. Inpatient SHO patients incurred significantly higher monthly costs after their initial SHO-related hospitalization than patients in the two other groups ($2,084 vs. $1,313 and $1,372), corresponding to 59% or 52% higher monthly costs for inpatient SHO patients. LIMITATIONS: These analyses excluded patients who did not seek ED or hospital care when faced with SHO; events may have been miscoded; and we were not able to account for clinical characteristics associated with SHO, such as insulin dose and duration of diabetes, or unmeasured confounders. CONCLUSIONS: The burden associated with SHO is not negligible. About 4% of T1DM patients using basal-bolus insulin regimens are hospitalized at least once due to SHO. Not only do those patients incur the costs of that SHO hospitalization, but also incur at least $712 (52%) more in costs per month after their hospitalization than outpatient SHO or comparison patients. Reducing SHO events can help decrease the burden associated with SHO among patients with T1DM.","type+1+diabetes"],["Innate Viral Receptor Signaling Determines Type 1 Diabetes Onset.",["Morse ZJ","Horwitz MS"],"Front Endocrinol (Lausanne). 2017 Sep 26;8:249. doi: 10.3389/fendo.2017.00249. eCollection 2017.","Heritable susceptibility of the autoimmune disorder, type 1 diabetes (T1D), only partially equates for the incidence of the disease. Significant evidence attributes several environmental stressors, such as vitamin D deficiency, gut microbiome, dietary antigens, and most notably virus infections in triggering the onset of T1D in these genetically susceptible individuals. Extensive epidemiological and clinical studies have provided credibility to this causal relationship. Infection by the enterovirus, coxsackievirus B, has been closely associated with onset of T1D and is considered a significant etiological agent for disease induction. Recognition of viral antigens via innate pathogen-recognition receptors induce inflammatory events which contribute to autoreactivity of pancreatic self-antigens and ultimately the destruction of insulin-secreting beta cells. The activation of these specific innate pathways and expression of inflammatory molecules, including type I and III interferon, prime the immune system to elicit either a protective regulatory response or a diabetogenic effector response. Therefore, sensing of viral antigens by retinoic acid-inducible gene I-like receptors and toll-like receptors may be detrimental to inducing autoreactivity initiated by viral stress and resulting in T1D.","type+1+diabetes"],["Type 1 Diabetes and Celiac Disease: Causal Association or True, True, Unrelated?",["Ferrara CT","Gitelman SE"],"Pediatrics. 2017 Oct 10. pii: e20172424. doi: 10.1542/peds.2017-2424.","","type+1+diabetes"],["Co-occurrence of Type 1 Diabetes and Celiac Disease Autoimmunity.",["Hagopian W","Lee HS","Liu E","Rewers M","She JX","Ziegler AG","Lernmark A","Toppari J","Rich SS","Krischer JP","Erlich H","Akolkar B","Agardh D"],"Pediatrics. 2017 Oct 10. pii: e20171305. doi: 10.1542/peds.2017-1305.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Few birth cohorts have prospectively followed development of type 1 diabetes (T1D) and celiac disease (CD) autoimmunities to determine timing, extent of co-occurrence, and associated genetic and demographic factors.

Along with demographic factors and HLA-DR-DQ, genotypes for HLA-DPB1 and 5 non-HLA loci conferring risk of both T1D and CD were analyzed. RESULTS: Development of persistent islet autoantibodies (IAs) and tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies (tTGAs), as well as each clinical disease, was evaluated quarterly from 3 to 48 months of age and semiannually thereafter. IAs alone appeared in 367, tTGAs alone in 808, and both in 90 children. Co-occurrence significantly exceeded the expected rate. IAs usually, but not always, appeared earlier than tTGAs. IAs preceding tTGAs was associated with increasing risk of tTGAs (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.48; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.15-1.91). After adjusting for country, sex, family history, and all other genetic loci, significantly greater co-occurrence was observed in children with a T1D family history (HR: 2.80), HLA-DR3/4 (HR: 1.94) and single-nucleotide polymorphism rs3184504 at SH2B3 (HR: 1.53). However, observed co-occurrence was not fully accounted for by all analyzed factors. CONCLUSIONS: In early childhood, T1D autoimmunity usually precedes CD autoimmunity. Preceding IAs significantly increases the risk of subsequent tTGAs. Co-occurrence is greater than explained by demographic factors and extensive genetic risk loci, indicating that shared environmental or pathophysiological mechanisms may contribute to the increased risk.","type+1+diabetes"],["Muscle functions and bone strength are impaired in adolescents with type 1 diabetes.",["Maratova K","Soucek O","Matyskova J","Hlavka Z","Petruzelkova L","Obermannova B","Pruhova S","Kolouskova S","Sumnik Z"],"Bone. 2017 Oct 7;106:22-27. doi: 10.1016/j.bone.2017.10.005.","BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia and osteoporosis are among the late complications of type 1 diabetes (T1D) in adults.

It is free of ethical dilemmas, non-tumorigenic, and less immunogenic and thus provides a significant advantage over other stem cell sources. The cord lining yields both mesenchymal and epithelial stem cells. The mesenchymal cells have been appraised at length by many researchers, which led to the current review focusing on the cord lining epithelial cells (CLECs). These cells have high proliferative capacity and their superior harvest and multiplication, using the revolutionary CellOptimaTM technology, makes them better candidates in comparison to contemporary adult stem cells. Following 30 replication cycles these cells have been observed to retain their stemness, with their phenotype and karyotype intact. However, their remarkable immunosuppressant properties, protecting self as well as co-transplanted allografts from rejection, are what truly define their transplantation potential. They have been successfully applied to many chronic conditions, using animal models, including type 1 diabetes, limbal stem cell deficiency, burn injuries, and wound healing, etc. with encouraging results. CONCLUSIONS: This review first discusses some of the advantages afforded by CLECs over other stem cell lines and then delineates their potential use in various clinical applications.

NK cells recognize their target cells through a delicate balance of inhibitory and stimulatory receptors on their surface. If unbalanced, NK cells have great potential to wreak havoc in the pancreas due to the beta cell expression of the as-yet-defined NKp46 ligand through interactions with the activating NKp46 receptor found on the surface of most NK cells. Blocking interactions between NKp46 and its ligand protects mice from STZ-induced diabetes, but differential expression non-diabetic and diabetic donor samples have not been tested. Additional studies have shown that peripheral blood NK cells from human T1D patients have altered phenotypes that reduce the lytic and functional ability of the NK cells. Investigations of humanT1D pancreas tissues have indicated that the presence of NK cells may be beneficial despite their infrequent detection. In non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, we have noted that NK cells express high levels of the proinflammatory mediator 12/15-lipoxygenase (12/15-LO), and decreased levels of stimulatory receptors. Conversely, NK cells of 12/15-LO deficient NOD mice, which are protected from diabetes development, express significantly higher levels of stimulatory receptors. Furthermore, the human NK92 cell line expresses the ALOX12 protein [human 12-lipoxygenase (12-LO), related to mouse 12/15-LO] via Western blotting. Human 12-LO is upregulated in the pancreas of both T1D and T2D human donors with insulin-containing islets, showing a link between 12-LO expression and diabetes progression. Therefore, our hypothesis is that NK cells in those susceptible to developing T1D are unable to function properly during viral infections of pancreatic beta cells due to increased 12-LO expression and activation, which contributes to increased interferon-gamma production and an imbalance in activating and inhibitory NK cell receptors, and may contribute to downstream autoimmune T cell responses.

The T1D group was further sub-divided based on whether subjects had normal, impaired, or indeterminate awareness of hypoglycemia (n = 31, 20, and 1, respectively). Our goals were to test whether the gray matter (GM) volumes of selected brain regions were associated with diabetes status as well as with the status of hypoglycemia awareness. T1D subjects were found to have slightly smaller volume of the whole cortex as compared to controls (-2.7%, p = 0.016), with the most affected brain region being the frontal lobe (-3.6%, p = 0.024). Similar differences of even larger magnitude were observed among the T1D subjects based on their hypoglycemia awareness status. Indeed, compared to the patients with normal awareness of hypoglycemia, patients with impaired awareness had smaller volume of the whole cortex (-7.9%, p = 0.0009), and in particular of the frontal lobe (-9.1%, p = 0.006), parietal lobe (-8.0%, p = 0.015) and temporal lobe (-8.2%, p = 0.009). Such differences were very similar to those observed between patients with impaired awareness and controls (-7.6%, p = 0.0002 in whole cortex, -9.1%, p = 0.0003 in frontal lobe, -7.8%, p = 0.002 in parietal lobe, and -6.4%, p = 0.019 in temporal lobe). On the other hand, patients with normal awareness did not present significant volume differences compared to controls. No group-differences were observed in the occipital lobe or in the anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate, hippocampus, and thalamus. We conclude that diabetes status is associated with a small but statistically significant reduction of the whole cortex volume, mainly in the frontal lobe. The most prominent structural effects occurred in patients with impaired awareness of hypoglycemia (IAH) as compared to those with normal awareness, perhaps due to the long-term exposure to recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia.

The incidence of CT1DM in Oceanic climate [10.56 (8.69-12.42)] is highest compared with other climates; the incidence in 40 degrees -66 degrees 34'N/S [14.71 (12.30-17.29)] is higher than other latitude groups; the incidence in sunshine durations with 3-4 hours per day [15.17 (11.14-19.20)] is highest compared with other two groups; the incidence of CT1DM from 2000 to 2012 [19.58 (14.55-24.60)] is higher than other periods; all p < 0.01. Incidence of CT1DM was increasing from 1965 to 2012, but incidence in Oceanic climate is higher than other climates. Furthermore, it is higher in centers with higher latitude and lower sunshine durations.

To this end, a longitudinal proteomic profiling of human plasma using TMT-10plex-based LC-MS/MS analysis was performed to track temporal proteomic changes of T1D patients (n=11) across 9 serial time points, spanning the period of T1D natural progression, in comparison with those of the matching healthy controls (n=10). To our knowledge, the current study represents the largest (>2000 proteins measured) longitudinal expression profiles of human plasma proteome in T1D research. By applying statistical trend analysis on the temporal expression patterns between T1D and controls, and Benjamini-Hochberg procedure for multiple-testing correction, 13 protein groups were regarded as having statistically significant differences during the entire follow-up period. Moreover, 16 protein groups, which play pivotal roles in response to oxidative stress, have consistently abnormal expression trend before seroconversion to islet autoimmunity. Importantly, the expression trends of two key reactive oxygen species-decomposing enzymes, Catalase and Superoxide dismutase were verified independently by ELISA. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The temporal changes of >2000 plasma proteins (at least quantified in two subjects), spanning the entire period of T1D natural progression were provided to the research community. Oxidative stress related proteins have consistently different dysregulated patterns in T1D group than in age-sex matched healthy controls, even prior to appearance of islet autoantibodies - the earliest sign of islet autoimmunity and pancreatic beta cell stress.","type+1+diabetes"],["The anti-aging protein Klotho is induced by GABA therapy and exerts protective and stimulatory effects on pancreatic beta cells.",["Prud'homme GJ","Glinka Y","Kurt M","Liu W","Wang Q"],"Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2017 Dec 2;493(4):1542-1547. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.10.029.

In beta cells, it increases insulin secretion, prevents apoptosis, and induces regeneration. It is unclear how GABA mediates these effects. We hypothesized that Klotho is involved. It is a multi-functional protein expressed in the kidneys, brain, pancreatic beta cells, other tissues, and is cell-bound or soluble. Klotho knockout mice display accelerated aging, and in humans Klotho circulating levels decline with age, renal disease and diabetes. Here, we report that GABA markedly increased circulating levels of Klotho in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes. GABA also increased Klotho in the islet of Langerhans of normal mice, as well as the islets and kidneys of STZ-treated mice. In vitro, GABA stimulated production and secretion of Klotho by human islet cells. Knockdown (KD) of Klotho with siRNA in INS-1E insulinoma cells abrogated the protective effects of GABA against STZ toxicity. Following KD, soluble Klotho reversed the effects of Klotho deficiency. In human islet cells soluble Klotho protected against cell death, and stimulated proliferation and insulin secretion. NF-kappaB activation triggers beta-cell apoptosis, and both GABA and Klotho suppress this pathway. We found Klotho KD augmented NF-kappaB p65 expression, and abrogated the ability of GABA to block NF-kappaB activation. This is the first report that GABAergic stimulation increases Klotho expression. Klotho protected and stimulated beta cells and lack of Klotho (KD) was reversed by soluble Klotho.

CAN diagnosis is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, often due to progressive atherosclerosis. Carotid intima media thickness(CIMT) is a surrogate marker of the atherosclerosis. The aim of our study was to evaluate the relationship between CIMT and CAN in T1DM patients. METHODS: Total of 49 T1DM patients and 45 healthy controls were examined for CAN presence and CIMT. CAN was diagnosed based on the results of Ewing test battery and spectral analysis of heart rate variability. CIMT was measured by two-dimensional ultrasound. Biochemical, anthropometric and anamnestic risk markers of atherosclerosis were evaluated. We used logistic types of generalized additive models(GAM) for statistical analysis. RESULTS: CAN was detected in 22 out of 49 T1DM patients(45%). All 45 healthy controls had normal cardiovascular autonomic tests results.

One way in which ROS shape the autoimmune response demonstrated in T1D is by promoting CD4+ T cell activation and differentiation. As CD4+ T cells are a significant contributor to pancreatic cell destruction in T1D, understanding how ROS impact their development, activation, and differentiation is critical. Recent advances: CD4+ T cells themselves generate ROS via NADPH oxidase expression and electron transport chain activity. Moreover, T cells can also be exposed to exogenous ROS generated by other immune cells (ex. macrophages and dendritic cells) and cells. Genetically modified animals and ROS inhibitors have demonstrated that ROS blockade during activation results in CD4+ T cell hyporesponsiveness and reduced diabetes incidence. Critical issues and future directions: While the majority of studies with regards to T1D and CD4+ T cells has been done to examine the influence of redox on CD4+ T cell activation, this is not the only circumstance in which a T cell can be impacted by redox. ROS and redox have also been shown to play roles in CD4+ T cell-related tolerogenic mechanisms including thymic selection and regulatory T cell-mediated suppression. However, the effect of these mechanisms with respect to T1D pathogenesis remains elusive. Therefore, pursuing these avenues may provide valuable insight into the global role of ROS and redox in autoreactive CD4+ T cell formation and function.","type+1+diabetes"],["Pandemrix(R) vaccination is not associated with increased risk of islet autoimmunity or type 1 diabetes in the TEDDY study children.",["Elding Larsson H","Lynch KF","Lonnrot M","Haller MJ","Lernmark A","Hagopian WA","She JX","Simell O","Toppari J","Ziegler AG","Akolkar B","Krischer JP","Rewers MJ","Hyoty H"],"Diabetologia. 2017 Oct 9. doi: 10.1007/s00125-017-4448-3.","AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: During the A/H1N1 2009 (A/California/04/2009) pandemic, mass vaccination with a squalene-containing vaccine, Pandemrix(R), was performed in Sweden and Finland.

Here, we investigated the impact of hyperglycemia along with a simultaneous or late insulin replacement on the ventral prostate growth in rats during puberty, paying special attention to the deposition of collagen fibers and activities of gelatinase, matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), and -9 (MMP-9). Hyperglycemia was induced by streptozotocin (STZ) administration in 40-day-old male Wistar rats. A subset of hyperglycemic rats underwent an early insulin replacement (three days after the STZ administration), and another subset underwent a late insulin replacement (twenty days after the STZ administration). Animals were euthanized at 60 and/or 80 days of age. The ventral prostatic lobe was processed for picrosirius red staining, type I and III collagen immunohistochemistry, and gelatin zymography. Hyperglycemic animals showed an increased area of collagen fibers in the prostate, which was composed both types of collagens. MMP-2 activity was significantly reduced in the hyperglycemic animals, while MMP-9 activity was very low and showed no alteration. The simultaneous and late insulin administration restored collagen content and MMP-2 activity.

Evidence is insufficient to support a broad application of islet autoantibody screening for T1DM in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to assess the evidence of an association between islet autoantibodies and the development of T1DM in a pooled population of both genetically at-risk individuals and general people without definite genetic background. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was performed of Pubmed, Web of knowledge and Cochrane library. Prospective cohort studies evaluating the role of islet autoantibodies in prediction of T1DM progression were included. Risk ratios (RRs) were calculated and pooled to arrive at summary estimate. chi2 and I2-values were calculated as measures of heterogeneity and subgroup analyses were performed to explore sources of heterogeneity. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies matched the inclusion criteria. A total of 71,482 nondiabetic participants who were genetically at-risk individuals or from the general population were included, and 926 cases of T1DM were reported during a median follow-up of 7 years. Compared with people free of islet autoantibody, those positive for any type or number of islet autoantibody showed a significantly increased risk of developing T1DM (RR 150.42 [95% CI 87.34, 259.04]). Moreover, the risk for people with multiple islet autoantibodies was 8.59-fold higher than the risk for those with single islet autoantibody, although a moderate heterogeneity existed between studies. The subgroup analysis further revealed that RRs of multiple islet autoantibodies in at-risk population and general population were 7.17 and 13.72, respectively. CONCLUSION: This study established the association between the seroconversion of islet autoantibodies and T1DM progression in nondiabetic people with or without definite genetic susceptibility, providing further evidence for an extensive application in routine clinical practice to identify individuals at risk of T1DM.","type+1+diabetes"],["Lipid environment induces ER stress, TXNIP expression and inflammation in immune cells of individuals with type 2 diabetes.",["Szpigel A","Hainault I","Carlier A","Venteclef N","Batto AF","Hajduch E","Bernard C","Ktorza A","Gautier JF","Ferre P","Bourron O","Foufelle F"],"Diabetologia. 2017 Oct 7. doi: 10.1007/s00125-017-4462-5.","AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Obesity and type 2 diabetes are concomitant with low-grade inflammation affecting insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion. Recently, the thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) has been implicated in the activation process of the NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. In this study, we aim to determine whether the expression of TXNIP is altered in the circulating immune cells of individuals with type 2 vs type 1 diabetes and whether this can be related to specific causes and consequences of inflammation. METHODS: The expression of TXNIP, inflammatory markers, markers of the unfolded protein response (UPR) to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and enzymes involved in sphingolipid metabolism was quantified by quantitative reverse transcription real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 13 non-diabetic individuals, 23 individuals with type 1 diabetes and 81 with type 2 diabetes. A lipidomic analysis on the plasma of 13 non-diabetic individuals, 35 individuals with type 1 diabetes and 94 with type 2 diabetes was performed. The effects of ER stress or of specific lipids on TXNIP and inflammatory marker expression were analysed in human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDMs) and THP-1 cells. RESULTS: The expression of TXNIP and inflammatory and UPR markers was increased in the PBMCs of individuals with type 2 diabetes when compared with non-diabetic individuals or individuals with type 1 diabetes. TXNIP expression was significantly correlated with plasma fasting glucose, plasma triacylglycerol concentrations and specific UPR markers. Induction of ER stress in THP-1 cells or cultured HMDMs led to increased expression of UPR markers, TXNIP, NLRP3 and IL-1beta. Conversely, a chemical chaperone reduced the expression of UPR markers and TXNIP in PBMCs of individuals with type 2 diabetes. The lipidomic plasma analysis revealed an increased concentration of saturated dihydroceramide and sphingomyelin in individuals with type 2 diabetes when compared with non-diabetic individuals and individuals with type 1 diabetes. In addition, the expression of specific enzymes of sphingolipid metabolism, dihydroceramide desaturase 1 and sphingomyelin synthase 1, was increased in the PBMCs of individuals with type 2 diabetes. Palmitate or C2 ceramide induced ER stress in macrophages as well as increased expression of TXNIP, NLRP3 and IL-1beta. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In individuals with type 2 diabetes, circulating immune cells display an inflammatory phenotype that can be linked to ER stress and TXNIP expression. Immune cell ER stress can in turn be linked to the specific exogenous and endogenous lipid environment found in type 2 diabetes.","type+1+diabetes"],["Oral health status of children with type 1 diabetes: a comparative study.",["Ismail AF","McGrath CP","Yiu CKY"],"J Pediatr Endocrinol Metab. 2017 Oct 9. pii: /j/jpem.ahead-of-print/jpem-2017-0053/jpem-2017-0053.xml. doi: 10.1515/jpem-2017-0053.","BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to compare the oral health status of children with type 1 diabetes and healthy controls.

Although dysregulated miRNA profiles have been identified in T1DM patients, results are inconclusive; with only few miRNAs being consistently dysregulated among studies. Thus, we performed a systematic review of the literature on the subject, followed by bioinformatics analysis, to point out which miRNAs are dysregulated in T1DM-related tissues and in which pathways they act. PubMed and EMBASE were searched to identify all studies that compared miRNA expressions between T1DM patients and non-diabetic controls. Those miRNAs consistently dysregulated in T1DM-related tissues were submitted to bioinformatics analysis to retrieve their putative targets and identify potentially affected pathways under their regulation. As result, twenty-nine studies were included in the systematic review. Among 249 dysregulated miRNAs reported in these studies, 63 (25.4%) were reported in at least 2 studies; however, only 34 of them were analyzed in tissues directly related to T1DM pathogenesis [serum/plasma, pancreas, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)].

These miRNAs are involved in pathways related to immune system function, cell survival, cell proliferation, and insulin biosynthesis and secretion. In conclusion, eight circulating miRNAs seem to be dysregulated in T1DM patients in different studies, being potential circulating biomarkers of this disease.","type+1+diabetes"],["Activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocytes by insulin and GAD in patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus.",["Arneth BM"],"Endocr Connect. 2017 Oct 6. pii: EC-17-0230. doi: 10.1530/EC-17-0230.","BACKGROUND: The origin of autoimmune disease type 1 diabetes is still unknown. AIM: This study assessed the activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocytes by human insulin and human glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and healthy volunteers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The expression of CD69, a marker of T-lymphocyte activity, was determined in whole blood samples by flow cytometry after 12 h of incubation with or without insulin or GAD. The analysis included samples from 12 type 1 DM patients, 14 type 2 DM patients, and 12 healthy volunteers.

DISCUSSION: These results indicated that latent pre-activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocytes in response to insulin or GAD epitopes occurred in type 1 DM patients.

To overcome the limitations of the traditional methods this paper proposes the use of an artificial intelligence technique, case-based reasoning, to personalise the bolus calculation. A novel aspect of our approach is the use of temporal sequences to take into account preceding events when recommending the bolus insulin doses rather than looking at events in isolation. The in silico results described in this paper show that given the initial conditions of the patient, the temporal retrieval algorithm identifies the most suitable case for reuse.

Epub 2017 Aug 8.","This article describes the Hage framework for theory construction and its application to the clinical problem of glycemic control in college-aged students with type 1 diabetes. College-aged students with type 1 diabetes struggle to self-manage their condition. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), if controlled within acceptable limits (6-8%), is associated with the prevention or delay of serious diabetic complications such as kidney and cardiovascular disease. Diabetes educators provide knowledge and skills, but young adults must self-manage their condition on a daily basis, independent of parents. The Hage framework includes five tasks of theory construction: narrowing and naming the concepts, specifying the definitions, creating the theoretical statements, specifying the linkages, and ordering components in preparation for model building. During the process, concepts within the theory were revised as the literature was reviewed, and measures and hypotheses, foundational to research, were generated. We were successful in applying the framework and creating a model of factors affecting glycemic control, emphasizing that physical activity, thought of as a normal part of wellness, can be a two-edged sword producing positive effect but also serious negative effects in some college-aged students with type 1 diabetes. Contextual factors important to self-management in college-aged students are emphasized. The Hage framework, already used to a small extent in nursing curricula, deserves more attention and, because of its generic nature, may be used as a template for theory construction to examine a wide variety of nursing topics.","type+1+diabetes"],["Screening for celiac disease in poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus: worth it or not?",["Kizilgul M","Ozcelik O","Beysel S","Akinci H","Kan S","Ucan B","Apaydin M","Cakal E"],"BMC Endocr Disord. 2017 Oct 6;17(1):62. doi: 10.1186/s12902-017-0212-4.","BACKGROUND: Recent studies have demonstrated that immune factors might have a role in the pathophysiology of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

Our aim was to investigate the prevalence of celiac disease among insulin-using type 2 diabetes patients with inappropriate glycemic control. METHODS: IgA tissue transglutaminase antibodies (tTGA IgA) test was performed as a screening test. A total of 135 patients with T2DM whose control of glycemia is inappropriate (HbAlc value >7%) in spite of using insulin treatment for at least 3-months (only insulin or insulin with oral antidiabetic drugs) and 115 healthy controls were enrolled in the study.

RESULTS: Gender, age, body mass index (BMI) and tTGA IgA, kreatinin, calcium, LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol, 25-OH vitamin D3 levels were similar between groups. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, waist circumference, fasting plasma glucose, postprandial plasma glucose, urea, sodium, HbA1c, LDL-C, triglyceride, vitamin B12 levels were significantly higher in DM group (p < 0.0001).

However, the genetic determinants of age at diagnosis (AAD) of type 1 diabetes remain relatively unexplained. Identification of AAD genes and pathways could provide insight into the earliest events in the disease process. METHODS: Using ImmunoChip data from 15,696 cases, we aimed to identify regions in the genome associated with AAD. RESULTS: Two regions were convincingly associated with AAD (p < 5 x 10-8): the MHC on 6p21, and 6q22.33. Fine-mapping of 6q22.33 identified two AAD-associated haplotypes in the region nearest to the genes encoding protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor kappa (PTPRK) and thymocyte-expressed molecule involved in selection (THEMIS). We examined the susceptibility to type 1 diabetes at these SNPs by performing a meta-analysis including 19,510 control participants. Although these SNPs were not associated with type 1 diabetes overall (p > 0.001), the SNP most associated with AAD, rs72975913, was associated with susceptibility to type 1 diabetes in those individuals diagnosed at less than 5 years old (p = 2.3 x 10-9). CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: PTPRK and its neighbour THEMIS are required for early development of the thymus, which we can assume influences the initiation of autoimmunity. Non-HLA genes may only be detectable as risk factors for the disease in individuals diagnosed under the age 5 years because, after that period of immune development, their role in disease susceptibility has become redundant.","type+1+diabetes"],["Random non-fasting C-peptide testing can identify patients with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes at high risk of hypoglycaemia.",["Hope SV","Knight BA","Shields BM","Hill AV","Choudhary P","Strain WD","McDonald TJ","Jones AG"],"Diabetologia. 2017 Oct 5. doi: 10.1007/s00125-017-4449-2.","AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The aim of this study was to determine whether random non-fasting C-peptide (rCP) measurement can be used to assess hypoglycaemia risk in insulin-treated type 2 diabetes.

This study aims to investigate the effects of whole-body vibration (WBV), an easy and non-invasive biophysical method, on bone microstructure, tissue-level mechanical properties and porous titanium (pTi) osseointegration in alloxan-diabetic rabbits. Six non-diabetic and twelve alloxan-treated diabetic rabbits were equally assigned to the Control, DM, and DM with WBV stimulation (WBV) groups. A cylindrical drill-hole defect was established on the left femoral lateral condyle of all rabbits and filled with a novel non-toxic Ti2448 pTi. Rabbits in the WBV group were exposed to 1h/day WBV (0.3g, 30Hz) for 8weeks. After sacrifice, the left femoral condyles were harvested for histological, histomorphometric and nanoindentation analyses. The femoral sample with 2-cm height above the defect was used for qRT-PCR analysis. The right distal femora were scanned with muCT. We found that all alloxan-treated rabbits exhibited hyperglycemia throughout the experimental period. WBV inhibited the deterioration of cancellous and cortical bone architecture and tissue-level mechanical properties via muCT, histological and nanoindentation examinations. T1DM-induced reduction of bone formation was inhibited by WBV, as evidenced by elevated serum OCN and increased mineral apposition rate (MAR), whereas no alteration was observed in bone resorption marker TRACP5b. WBV also stimulated more adequate ingrowths of mineralized bone tissue into pTi pore spaces, and improved peri-implant bone tissue-level mechanical properties and MAR in T1DM bone defects. WBV mitigated the reductions in femoral BMP2, OCN, Wnt3a, Lrp6, and beta-catenin and inhibited Sost mRNA expression but did not alter RANKL or RANK gene expression in T1DM rabbits. Our findings demonstrated that WBV improved bone architecture, tissue-level mechanical properties, and pTi osseointegration by promoting canonical Wnt signaling-mediated skeletal anabolic response.

Catheter insertion and maintenance damage capillaries, lymphatics, cells, and connective tissue leading to an acute inflammatory response. METHODS: We compared an investigational CSII catheter (IC) and a commercial CSII catheter (CC) regarding insulin absorption pharmacokinetics (PK) and tissue inflammation. The two different catheter designs were implanted into the subcutaneous tissue of six swine for 5 days. Insulin boluses were given on days 1, 3, and 5 of wear-time to assess PK. Tissue around catheters was excised and stained to visualize inflammation and morphological changes of adjacent tissue. RESULTS: Insulin absorption was better when infused through a CC with highest Cmax and fastest tmax values on day 5 of catheter wear-time. Both catheter types produced high intra- and intersubject day-to-day insulin absorption variability. The IC caused significantly more tissue disruption and lead to irregular changes in tissue morphology. Both catheter types were surrounded by a layer of inflammatory tissue that varied in composition, thickness, and density over time. A catheter that was manually inserted by pushing a sharp tip through the skin caused more trauma and variability than a 90 degrees Teflon cannula with automated insertion. CONCLUSIONS: Insulin absorption variability could be attributed to the layer of inflammatory tissue, which may function as a mechanical barrier to insulin flow into adjacent vascular tissue. The impact of the acute inflammatory tissue response on insulin absorption has to be considered in future catheter designs. A catheter that was manually inserted by pushing a sharp tip through the skin caused more trauma and variability than a 90 degrees Teflon cannula with automated insertion.","type+1+diabetes"],["[Diabetes care pathways and the diabetic convention in 2017].",["de Brouckere V","Plat L"],"Rev Med Brux. 2017;38(4):347-352.","Diabetes is a chronic, pandemic disorder which has a growing impact on healthcare costs and leads to severe micro- and macro-vascular complications.

In this study, the inhibitory effect of freeze-dried A. sacrum (Asa) on the formation of diabetic cataracts (DCs) was evaluated. Type 1 diabetes was induced in mice using streptozotocin (STZ). The mice were divided into two groups: one was fed a normal diet (DM-control group) and the other was fed a diet containing 1% Asa (DM-Asa group). During the study, changes in blood glucose levels and the amount of food and water consumed were measured. After 3 mo, the amount of Nepsilon-(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML), an oxidative stress marker, in the lens was measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Although the blood glucose levels (p=0.91) and food consumption did not significantly change in any group, the oral administration of Asa tended to suppress CML accumulation (p=0.15) and significantly inhibited the progression of cataractogenesis in the diabetic lens compared with that reported for the normal diet (p=0.009). These results suggested that the daily intake of A. sacrum prevents the pathogenesis of cataracts, and indicated that may reduce the number of DC patients.","type+1+diabetes"],["In the setting of paediatric osteomyelitis do not be afraid to CAST an eye.",["Russell RA","Moylett E"],"BMJ Case Rep. 2017 Oct 4;2017. pii: bcr-2017-219683. doi: 10.1136/bcr-2017-219683.","The case commences with an innocuous right ankle injury (lateral malleolus), for which the patient, a 9-year-old boy, was placed in a temporary cast at his local hospital.

NOD mice with blood glucose levels of 250 to 350 mg/dL or 350 to 450 mg/dL were considered as new-onset or established overt diabetes, respectively. These diabetic NOD mice were transiently treated with an anti-TCR beta chain (TCRbeta) mAb, H57-597, for 5 days. Two weeks later, some NOD mice with established overt diabetes further received hepatic gene therapy using the islet-lineage determining gene Neurogenin3 (Ngn3), in combination with the islet growth factor gene betacellulin (Btc). We found that anti-TCRbeta mAb (50 microg/d) reversed >80% new-onset diabetes in NOD mice for >14 weeks by reducing the number of effector T cells in the pancreas. However, anti-TCRbeta mAb therapy alone reversed only approximately 20% established overt diabetes in these mice. Among those overtly diabetic NOD mice whose diabetes was resistant to anti-TCRbeta mAb treatment, approximately 60% no longer had diabetes when they also received Ngn3-Btc hepatic gene transfer 2 weeks after initial anti-TCRbeta mAb treatment. This combination of Ngn3-Btc gene therapy and anti-TCRbeta mAb treatment induced the sustained formation of periportal insulin-producing cells in the liver of overtly diabetic mice. Therefore, directly targeting TCRbeta with a mAb potently reverses new-onset T1D in NOD mice and protects residual and newly formed gene therapy-induced hepatic neo-islets from T-cellmediated destruction in mice with established overt diabetes.","type+1+diabetes"],["Genetic determinants of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration during pregnancy and type 1 diabetes in the child.",["Miettinen ME","Smart MC","Kinnunen L","Harjutsalo V","Reinert-Hartwall L","Ylivinkka I","Surcel HM","Lamberg-Allardt C","Hitman GA","Tuomilehto J"],"PLoS One. 2017 Oct 4;12(10):e0184942. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0184942. eCollection 2017.","OBJECTIVE: The in utero environment plays an important role in shaping development and later life health of the fetus. It has been shown that maternal genetic factors in the metabolic pathway of vitamin D associate with type 1 diabetes in the child. In this study we analyzed the genetic determinants of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) concentration during pregnancy in mothers whose children later developed type 1 diabetes and in control mothers. STUDY DESIGN: 474 mothers of type 1 diabetic children and 348 mothers of non-diabetic children were included in the study. We previously selected 7 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in four genes in the metabolic pathway of vitamin D vitamin based on our previously published data demonstrating an association between genotype and serum 25OHD concentration. In this re-analysis, possible differences in strength in the association between the SNPs and serum 25OHD concentration in mothers of type 1 diabetic and non-diabetic children were investigated. Serum 25OHD concentrations were previously shown to be similar between the mothers of type 1 diabetic and non-diabetic children and vitamin D deficiency prevalent in both groups. RESULTS: Associations between serum 25OHD concentration and 2 SNPs, one in the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene (rs4516035) and one in the group-specific component (GC) gene (rs12512631), were stronger during pregnancy in mothers whose children later developed type 1 diabetes than in mothers whose children did not (pinteraction = 0.03, 0.02, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: We show for the first time that there are differences in the strength of genetic determinants of serum 25OHD concentration during pregnancy between the mothers of type 1 diabetic and non-diabetic children. Our results emphasize that the in utero environment including maternal vitamin D metabolism should be important lines of investigation when searching for factors that lead to early programming of type 1 diabetes.","type+1+diabetes"],["Type 1 Diabetes and Long-Term Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion Therapy: A 10-Year Experience from Macedonia.",["Petrovski G","Zivkovic M","Stratrova SS","Todorova BJ"],"Diabetes Technol Ther. 2017 Oct 4. doi: 10.1089/dia.2017.0227.","BACKGROUND: Subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) therapy is a challenge for both patients and healthcare providers.

Therefore, the aim of our study was to determine risk factors for PE in women with T1DM. METHODS: This study was a prospective, nested case-control study on a population of 165 women with T1DM. Women were divided into 3 subgroups: normotensive (N = 141), gestational hypertension (GH) (N = 8), and PE (N = 16). Clinical data were collected in the first trimester (< 12th week), in mid-pregnancy (20-24th weeks), and just prior to delivery (34-39th weeks). IR in the first trimester was quantified using the estimated glucose disposal rate formula (eGDR, milligrams/kilogram/minute). Simple logistic regression was used to search for factors associated with PE and GH. For multivariate comparisons, we used multiple logistic regression with stepwise selection. RESULTS: All preeclampsia cases were diagnosed in primiparae. The presence of vasculopathy was the strongest determinant of PE (OR 10.8, 95% CI 3.27-35.97, P = 0.0001), followed by a history of chronic hypertension (6.05, 1.75-20.8, P = 0.004) and the duration of diabetes (1.11, 1.03-1.12, P = 0.009). However, chronic hypertension and duration of diabetes were no longer associated with PE after adjustment for the presence of vasculopathy. Higher gestational weight gain (GWG) was associated with PE, and this association remained significant after adjustment for first trimester body mass index (1.14, 1.02-1.28, P = 0.02). Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure assessed in the first trimester were significant determinants of PE; however, this association was no longer observed after adjustment for the presence of chronic hypertension. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels from all 3 trimesters were significantly associated with PE (first trimester: 1.38, 1.01-1.87, P = 0.04; second trimester: 2.76, 1.43-5.31, P = 0.002; third trimester: 2.42, 1.30-4.51, P = 0.005). There was a negative association between eGDR and PE (0.66, 0.50-0.87, P = 0.003). Among lipids, triglycerides (TG) in all 3 trimesters were positively associated with PE, and this association was independent of HbA1c levels (first trimester: 5.32, 1.65-17.18, P = 0.005; second trimester: 2.52, 1.02-6.26, P = 0.05; third trimester: 2.28, 1.39-3.74, P = 0.001.

CONCLUSIONS: Primiparity and diabetic vasculopathy seem to be the strongest risk factors for PE in women with type 1 diabetes. However, preexisting hypertension and higher GWG were also associated with PE in women with T1DM. Among laboratory results, higher HbA1c and TG levels in all 3 trimesters were associated with PE.

Although there is no cure for T1D, transplantation of pancreatic islets of Langerhans has the potential to restore normal endocrine function versus the morbidity of hypoglycemic unawareness that is commonly associated with sudden death among fragile diabetics. However, since endocrine islet tissues form a small proportion of the pancreas, sufficient islet numbers can be reached only by combining islets from multiple organ donors and the transplant plug contains significantly high levels of exocrine acinar tissue, thereby exacerbating immune responses. Hence, lifelong administration of immunosuppressants is required after transplantation, which can stress islet cells. The density gradient method that is currently used to separate islets from acinar tissue causes islets to be sparsely distributed over the centrifuged bins, so that the transplant sample obtained by combining multiple bins also contains significant acinar tissue levels. We show that in comparison to the significant size and density overlaps between the islet and acinar tissue populations post-organ digestion, their deformability overlaps are minimal. This feature is utilized to design a microfluidic separation strategy, wherein tangential flows enable selective deformation of acinar populations towards the bifurcating waste stream and sequential switching of hydrodynamic resistance enables the collection of rigid islets. Using 25 bifurcating daughter channels, a throughput of approximately 300 islets per hour per device is obtained for enabling islet enrichment from relatively dilute starting levels to purity levels that meet the transplant criteria, as well as to further enhance islet purity from samples following density gradient enrichment. Based on confirmation of viability and functionality of the microfluidic-isolated islets using insulin secretion analysis and an angiogenesis assay, we envision utilizing this strategy to generate small-volume transplant plugs with high islet purity and significantly reduced acinar levels for minimizing immune responses after transplantation.","type+1+diabetes"],["Proliferative glomerulonephritis with monoclonal IgG deposits; an unusual cause of de novo disease in kidney allograft.",["Hussain SM","Sureshkumar KK"],"J Nephropathol. 2017 Jul;6(3):220-224. doi: 10.15171/jnp.2017.36.

CASE PRESENTATION: A 38-year old female with type 1 diabetes who underwent successful simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) transplantation 6 years earlier presented with rising serum creatinine, nephrotic range proteinuria and microhematuria. She underwent extensive work up and kidney allograft biopsy revealed mesangial expansion and hypercelluarity on light microscopy, mesangial staining for IgG3, kappa light chains, C1q and C3 on immunofluorescence and abundant mesangial electron dense deposits without substructures on electron microscopy. Serum and urine immunofixation electrophoresis were negative. A diagnosis of de novo PGNMID was made. Patient's proteinuria improved and serum creatinine stabilized with conservative therapy. CONCLUSIONS: PGNMID can rarely develop in kidney allograft as recurrent or de novo disease and may be mislabeled as transplant glomerulopathy if careful immunofluorescence and electron microscopy are not performed on biopsy specimens.

Despite major biomedical and technological advances in diagnosis and treatment, treatments are frequently insufficient as they do not inhibit the progression of the underlying autoimmune response and often fail to prevent life-threatening complications. T1D is the result of autoimmune destruction of the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas, and the precise, mechanistic contribution of the immune system to disease pathogenesis and progression remains to be fully characterized. Ultimately, the combinatorial effect of concurrent factors, including beta cell fragility, exogenous stressors, and genetic priming of the innate and adaptive immune system, work together to induce T1D autoimmunity. Thus, T1D is the result of immunological defects and environmental pathogens, requiring the sustained attention of collaborative research teams such as FIFE: I & D with varied perspectives, unified by the universally held goal of finding a sustainable, life-long cure.

METHODS: This was a prospective nationwide follow-up study (Epigenetic, Genetic and Environmental Effects on Growth, Cognitive Functions and Metabolism in Offspring of Women with Type 1 Diabetes [EPICOM]) in a Danish population. We examined 278 offspring of women with type 1 diabetes from the Danish Diabetes Association Register born during 1993-1999 (index offspring) and 303 control offspring, identified through the Danish Central Office of Civil Registration and matched to the index offspring with respect to date of birth, sex and postal code. The offspring had an overall mean age of 16.7 years (range 13.0-20.4 years). The main outcomes were age-related changes in fasting OGTT-derived indices for insulin sensitivity (BIGTT-SI0-30-120, Matsuda index, HOMA-IR) and insulin secretion (acute insulin response [BIGTT-AIR0-0-30-120], insulinogenic index, HOMA of insulin secretory function [HOMA-beta], disposition index) and physical activity (International Physical Activity Questionnaire). In addition, we determined total body fat (TBF) percentage using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. RESULTS: We observed significantly lower insulin sensitivity in index offspring compared with control offspring, increasing with age. The differences were attenuated after adjustment for TBF percentage, but were still significant at 17 and 18 years of age. We also observed decreased disposition index and insulin secretion-sensitivity index-2 in index offspring at the same age, but we found no significant differences in other indices of insulin secretion compared with control offspring. With age, TBF percentage became increasingly more divergent between index and control offspring, and was consistently higher among female but not male index offspring. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Differences in insulin sensitivity between the offspring of women with type 1 diabetes and control offspring increased with age.

The IBD population was divided into three subgroups: Ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn's disease (CD) and Both the latter referring to those registered with both diagnoses. Subsequently, odds-ratios (OR) and 95%CI were obtained separately for each group and their respective controls. The use of Bonferoni post-test correction adjusted the significance level to P < 0.00125. P-values were estimated using Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: There were significantly more women than men in the registry, and a greater percentage of comorbidity in the IBD groups (P < 0.05). Twenty different IMDs were all significantly more frequent in the IBD group. Sixteen were associated with UC versus twelve with CD. In both UC and CD ORs were significantly increased (P < 0.00125) for primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), celiac disease, type 1 diabetes (T1D), sarcoidosis, asthma, iridocyclitis, psoriasis, pyoderma gangrenosum, rheumatoid arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. Restricted to UC (P < 0.00125) were autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cholangitis, Grave's disease, polymyalgia rheumatica, temporal arteritis , and atrophic gastritis. Restricted to CD (P < 0.00125) were psoriatic arthritis and episcleritis. Restricted to women with UC (P < 0.00125) were atrophic gastritis, rheumatoid arthritis, temporal arteritis, and polymyalgia rheumatica. Restricted to women with CD were episcleritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriatic arthritis. The only disease restricted to men (P < 0.00125) was sarcoidosis. CONCLUSION: Immune mediated diseases were significantly more frequent in patients with IBD. Our results strengthen the hypothesis that some IMDs and IBD may have overlapping pathogenic pathways.","type+1+diabetes"],["Short- and long-term consequences for offspring exposed to maternal diabetes: a review.",["Burlina S","Dalfra MG","Lapolla A"],"J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med. 2017 Oct 16:1-8. doi: 10.1080/14767058.2017.1387893.","The prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus is increasing, as is the worldwide prevalence of type 2 diabetes and obesity, even in children and adolescents.

Current evidence also supports the hypothesis that adult health and disease have developmental origins, and that disorders in early-life environments prompt metabolic imprinting that results in a greater risk of negative metabolic outcomes later in life. In particular, exposure in utero to maternal diabetes seems to influence long-term metabolic outcomes, carrying a higher risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes, and thus creating a vicious cycle for future generations. In this paper, the short- and long-term consequences of exposure in utero to hyperglycemia are reviewed, focusing particularly on the long-term metabolic consequences, and investigating the possible pathogenic mechanisms involved.","type+1+diabetes"],["Insulin Injection Site Adverse Effect in a Type 1 Diabetes Patient: An Unusual Presentation.",["Sahasrabudhe RA","Limaye TY","Gokhale VS"],"J Clin Diagn Res. 2017 Aug;11(8):OD10-OD11. doi: 10.7860/JCDR/2017/28919.10433.

Therefore, gene expression in 59 human islet preparations was analyzed and correlated with diabetes reversal after transplantation in diabetic mice. Analysis yielded 262 differentially expressed probesets, which together predict islet quality with 83% accuracy. Pathway analysis revealed that failing islet preparations activated inflammatory pathways, while functional islets showed increased regeneration pathway gene expression. Gene expression associated with apoptosis and oxygen consumption showed little overlap with each other or with the 262 probeset classifier, indicating that the three tests are measuring different aspects of islet cell biology. A subset of 36 probesets surpassed the predictive accuracy of the entire set for reversal of diabetes, and was further reduced by logistic regression to sets of 14 and 5 without losing accuracy. These genes were further validated with an independent cohort of 16 samples.

The research ideas of people with diabetes were identified in two ways: in 15 research question generation workshops involving approximately 100 patients and carers, and in a James Lind Alliance Type 1 Diabetes Priority Setting Partnership with approximately 580 patients, carers and clinicians (clinician question submissions were excluded from analysis). A total of 859 individual research questions were collected from patients and carers. Diabetes research funding activity was identified through extensive online searches which provided a total of 172 relevant research projects for analysis.

The overall finding of this study is that there is substantial convergence between the two research agendas, alongside some important areas of divergence. The key areas of divergence were found in care delivery, injection issues, psychosocial impacts and women's health.

METHODS: We generated a restricted set of comorbidities using the literature (via the MeSH(R) co-occurrence file). We extracted the 15 most co-occurring autoimmune diseases of the CD. We used mappings of the comorbidities to EHR terminologies: ICD-10 (billing codes), ATC (drugs) and UMLS (clinical reports). Finally, we extracted the concepts from the different data sources. We evaluated our approach using the correlation between prevalence estimates in our cohort and co-occurrence ranking in the literature. RESULTS: We retrieved the comorbidities for 741 patients with CD. 18.1% of patients had at least one of the 15 studied autoimmune disorders. Overall, 79.3% of the mapped concepts were detected only in text, 5.3% only in ICD codes and/or drugs prescriptions, and 15.4% could be found in both sources.

The first group served as control and the other two groups received an intraperitoneal injection of 45mg/kg streptozotocin (STZ) to develop diabetes. Then groups were treated for four weeks either with placebo or vitamin D (two injections of 20,000IU/kg). RESULTS: At the end of the experiment, two injection of vitamin D were found to result in a significant increase in plasma cholecalciferol, which could improve hyperglycaemia and hypoinsulinemia in diabetic rats. HbA1c concentration had a slight and insignificant decrease following vitamin D intake. In addition, a significant decline was observed in the serum IGF-I level of STZ-treated rats in comparison to the controls, which was compensated in the vitamin D group.

Cerebral injury was reversed by N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Here we tested if the pro-thrombotic phenotype seen in the systemic circulation and brain during diabetes was associated with increased MG-glycation of proteins, and if NAC could reverse this. METHODS: The streptozotocin (STZ)-induced mouse model of type 1 diabetes was used. Thrombus formation in venules and arterioles (pial circulation) was determined by intravital videomicroscopy using the light-dye method. Circulating blood platelet-leukocyte aggregates (PLAs) were analyzed by flow cytometry 1 wk before other measurements. GSH and MG levels in platelets were measured by HPLC. MG-modified proteins, glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPx-1), and superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) levels were detected in platelets by western blot at 20 weeks. Proteins involved in coagulation were quantified by ELISA. NAC (2mM) was given in drinking water for 3 weeks before the terminal experiment. RESULTS: Thrombus development was accelerated by diabetes in a time-dependent manner. % PLAs were significantly elevated by diabetes. Plasma activated plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 levels were progressively increased with diabetes duration, with tail bleeding time reduced by 20 wks diabetes. Diabetes lowered platelet GSH levels, GPx-1 and SOD-1 expression. This was associated with higher MG levels, and increased MG-adduct formation in platelets. NAC treatment partly or completely reversed the effects of diabetes. CONCLUSION: Collectively, these results show that the diabetic blood and brain become progressively more susceptible to platelet activation and thrombosis. NAC, given after the establishment of diabetes, may offer protection against the risk for stroke by altering both systemic and vascular prothrombotic responses via enhancing platelet GSH, and GSH-dependent MG elimination, as well as correcting levels of antioxidants such as SOD1 and GPx-1.","type+1+diabetes"],["An integrative review of the psychosocial facilitators and challenges of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion therapy in type 1 diabetes.",["Payk M","Robinson T","Davis D","Atchan M"],"J Adv Nurs. 2017 Sep 28. doi: 10.1111/jan.13463.","AIM: To use systematic methods to explore the psychosocial facilitators and challenges of insulin pump therapy among people with type 1 diabetes.

This gap in our knowledge results from the complex interaction between genetics, the immune system, and environmental factors that precipitate T1D in humans. A link between genetics, the immune system, and environmental factors are type 1 interferons (T1-IFNs). These cytokines are well known for inducing antiviral factors that limit infection by regulating innate and adaptive immune responses. Further, several T1D genetic risk loci are within genes that link innate and adaptive immune cell responses to T1-IFN. An additional clue that links T1-IFN to T1D is that these cytokines are a known constituent of the autoinflammatory milieu within the pancreas of patients with T1D. The presence of IFNalpha/beta is correlated with characteristic MHC class I (MHC-I) hyperexpression found in the islets of patients with T1D, suggesting that T1-IFNs modulate the cross-talk between autoreactive cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes and insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells.

Regarding the coping strategies for reducing stigma, the following four categories were derived from the analysis: (i) In a stable disease stage, patients coped with stigma by \"hiding their disease\" or (ii) \"pretending to be healthy\" by avoiding self-care behaviors in public. When they told others about their disease, they (iii) \"gradually spoke out to those around them about their illnesses.\" (iv) When they could not do either (i) or (ii), they resorted to \"limiting their social life\" or limiting interactions with others. CONCLUSION: Patients with type 1 diabetes changed their coping strategies for reducing stigma as the disease progressed because stigma was tied to their disease. Physical, psychological, social, and spiritual coping strategies are required to reduce stigma, and the strategies are interrelated. It is important for nurses to assess patients from various viewpoints, including the viewpoint of stigma.","type+1+diabetes"],["Evidence Supporting Serology Based Pathway for Diagnosing Coeliac Disease In Asymptomatic Children From High-Risk Groups.",["Paul SP","Sandhu BK","Spray CH","Basude D","Ramani P"],"J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr. 2017 Sep 27. doi: 10.1097/MPG.0000000000001757.","OBJECTIVE: The European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) guidelines for diagnosing coeliac disease (CD) in children were modified in 2012. They recommend that in symptomatic children with anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody (anti-tTG) titre of greater than 10-times upper limit of normal (>10xULN) and who have positive anti-endomysial antibody and HLA-DQ2/DQ8 haplotype, the diagnosis of CD can be based on serology. Aim of this study is to establish whether serology-based pathway of the ESPGHAN guidelines could also be reliably applied to asymptomatic children from high-risk groups. METHODS: From March 2007 - February 2017 prospective data on anti-tTG titre, age, sex and reason for screening was collected at diagnostic endoscopy on all asymptomatic children being diagnosed with CD. The relationship between modified Marsh-Oberhuber classification histological grading and contemporaneous anti-tTG titres was analysed. RESULTS: 157 asymptomatic children were diagnosed with CD. 84/157 (53.5%) had antitTG >10xULN (normal <10 IU/ml) and 75/84 were from high-risk groups. All 75 had definitive histological evidence (Marsh-Oberhuber 3a-3c) of small bowel enteropathy. 53/84 children had anti-tTG >200IU/ml and total villous atrophy was present in 29/53 (55%). Main reasons for serological screening were: type-1 diabetes mellitus (n = 36) and first-degree relatives with CD (n = 24). Mean age at diagnosis was 8.8 years. Serology-based diagnosis is cost-beneficial by around pound1275/child in the United Kingdom. CONCLUSION: All 75 asymptomatic children from high-risk groups with anti-tTG >10xULN had histology proven CD. This study provides further evidence that the guidelines for diagnosing CD by the serology-based pathway should be extended to these children.","type+1+diabetes"],["Targeting Innate Immunity for Type 1 Diabetes Prevention.",["Needell JC","Zipris D"],"Curr Diab Rep. 2017 Sep 27;17(11):113. doi: 10.1007/s11892-017-0930-z.","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Despite immense research efforts, type 1 diabetes (T1D) remains an autoimmune disease without a known trigger or approved intervention. Over the last three decades, studies have primarily focused on delineating the role of the adaptive immune system in the mechanism of T1D. The discovery of Toll-like receptors in the 1990s has advanced the knowledge on the role of the innate immune system in host defense as well as mechanisms that regulate adaptive immunity including the function of autoreactive T cells. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent investigations suggest that inflammation plays a key role in promoting a large number of autoimmune disorders including T1D. Data from the LEW1.WR1 rat model of virus-induced disease and the RIP-B7.1 mouse model of diabetes suggest that innate immune signaling plays a key role in triggering disease progression. There is also evidence that innate immunity may be involved in the course of T1D in humans; however, a small number of clinical trials have shown that interfering with the function of the innate immune system following disease onset exerts only a modest effect on beta-cell function. The data implying that innate immune pathways are linked with mechanisms of islet autoimmunity hold great promise for the identification of novel disease pathways that may be harnessed for clinical intervention. Nevertheless, more work needs to be done to better understand mechanisms by which innate immunity triggers beta-cell destruction and assess the therapeutic value in blocking innate immunity for diabetes prevention.","type+1+diabetes"],["The shape of the glucose concentration curve during an oral glucose tolerance test predicts risk for type 1 diabetes.",["Ismail HM","Xu P","Libman IM","Becker DJ","Marks JB","Skyler JS","Palmer JP","Sosenko JM"],"Diabetologia. 2017 Sep 27. doi: 10.1007/s00125-017-4453-6.","AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: We aimed to examine: (1) whether specific glucose-response curve shapes during OGTTs are predictive of type 1 diabetes development; and (2) the extent to which the glucose-response curve is influenced by insulin secretion. METHODS: Autoantibody-positive relatives of people with type 1 diabetes whose baseline OGTT met the definition of a monophasic or biphasic glucose-response curve were followed for the development of type 1 diabetes (n = 2627). A monophasic curve was defined as an increase in OGTT glucose between 30 and 90 min followed by a decline of >/= 0.25 mmol/l between 90 and 120 min. A biphasic response curve was defined as a decrease in glucose after an initial increase, followed by a second increase of >/= 0.25 mmol/l. Associations of type 1 diabetes risk with glucose curve shapes were examined using cumulative incidence curve comparisons and proportional hazards regression. C-peptide responses were compared with and without adjustments for potential confounders. RESULTS: The majority of participants had a monophasic curve at baseline (n = 1732 [66%] vs n = 895 [34%]). The biphasic group had a lower cumulative incidence of type 1 diabetes (p < 0.001), which persisted after adjustments for age, sex, BMI z score and number of autoantibodies (p < 0.001). Among the monophasic group, the risk of type 1 diabetes was greater for those with a glucose peak at 90 min than for those with a peak at 30 min; the difference persisted after adjustments (p < 0.001). Compared with the biphasic group, the monophasic group had a lower early C-peptide (30-0 min) response, a lower C-peptide index (30-0 min C-peptide/30-0 min glucose), as well as a greater 2 h C-peptide level (p < 0.001 for all). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Those with biphasic glucose curves have a lower risk of progression to type 1 diabetes than those with monophasic curves, and the risk among the monophasic group is increased when the glucose peak occurs at 90 min than at 30 min. Differences in glucose curve shapes between the monophasic and biphasic groups appear to be related to C-peptide responses.","type+1+diabetes"],["Hypoglycemic Potential of Aqueous Extract of Moringa oleifera Leaf and In Vivo GC-MS Metabolomics.",["Khan W","Parveen R","Chester K","Parveen S","Ahmad S"],"Front Pharmacol. 2017 Sep 12;8:577. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2017.00577. eCollection 2017.","Moringa oleifera Lam.

Hypoglycemic properties of extract have been tested on carbohydrate digesting enzyme activity, yeast cell uptake, muscle glucose uptake, and intestinal glucose absorption. Type 2 diabetes was induced by feeding high-fat diet (HFD) for 8 weeks and a single injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 45 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneally) was used for the induction of type 1 diabetes. Aqueous extract of M. oleifera leaf was given orally at a dose of 100 mg/kg to STZ-induced rats and 200 mg/kg in HFD mice for 3 weeks after diabetes induction. Aqueous extract remarkably inhibited the activity of alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase and it displayed improved antioxidant capacity, glucose tolerance and rate of glucose uptake in yeast cell. In STZ-induced diabetic rats, it produces a maximum fall up to 47.86% in acute effect whereas, in chronic effect, it was 44.5% as compared to control. The fasting blood glucose, lipid profile, liver marker enzyme level were significantly (p < 0.05) restored in both HFD and STZ experimental model. Multivariate principal component analysis on polar and lipophilic metabolites revealed clear distinctions in the metabolite pattern in extract and in blood after its oral administration.

Unfortunately, the efficacy of treatment regimens on maintaining/re-gaining functional beta cell mass can, at the present, only be determined indirectly. Direct monitoring of beta cell mass is complicated by the anatomy of the endocrine pancreas, which consists of thousands to a million of discrete micro-organs, i.e. islets of Langerhans, which are scattered throughout the pancreas. SCOPE OF REVIEW: Here, we review the progress made over the last years using the anterior chamber of the eye as a transplantation site for functional imaging of pancreatic islet cells in the living organism. Islets engrafted on the iris are vascularized and innervated and the cornea, serving as a natural body-window, allows for microscopic, non-invasive, longitudinal evaluation of islet/beta cell function and survival with single-cell resolution in health and disease. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: Data provided by us and others demonstrate the high versatility of this imaging platform. The use of 'reporter islets' engrafted in the eye, reporting on the status of in situ endogenous islets in the pancreas of the same animal, allows the identification of key-events in the development and progression of diabetes. This will not only serve as a versatile research tool but will also lay the foundation for a personalized medicine approach and will serve as a screening platform for new drugs and/or treatment protocols. 'Metabolic' islet transplantation, in which islets engrafted in the eye replace the endogenous beta cells, will allow for the establishment of islet-specific transgenic models and 'humanized' mouse models as well as serving as the basis for a new clinical transplantation site for the cure of diabetes.","type+1+diabetes"],["The impact of ethnicity, educational and economic status on the prescription of insulin therapeutic regimens and on glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes.

The global Hypoglycemia Assessment Tool (HAT) study was designed to assess the global incidence of hypoglycemia in patients with insulin-treated diabetes, and the results have indicated that the overall incidence of hypoglycemia is high, with large variations between geographical regions. METHODS: The International Operations HAT (IO HAT) study retrospectively and prospectively assessed the incidence of hypoglycemia in patients with insulin-treated diabetes in Bangladesh, Colombia, Egypt, Indonesia, Philippines, Singapore, South Africa, Turkey, and United Arab Emirates.

Although near-normal glucose levels and insulin independence can be maintained for many years following successful islet transplantation, restoration of normal functional beta-cell mass has remained elusive. It has recently been proposed that dedifferentiation/plasticity towards other endocrine phenotypes may play an important role in stress-induced beta-cell dysfunction in type 2 diabetes. Here we report loss of end-differentiated beta-cell phenotype in 2 intraportal islet allotransplant recipients. Despite excellent graft function and sustained insulin independence, all examined insulin-positive cells had lost expression of the end-differentiation marker, urocortin-3, or appeared to co-express the alpha-cell marker, glucagon. In contrast, no insulin+ /urocortin-3- cells were seen in nondiabetic deceased donor control pancreatic islets. Loss of end-differentiated phenotype may facilitate beta-cell survival during the stresses associated with islet isolation and culture, in addition to sustained hypoxia following engraftment. As further refinements in islet isolation and culture are made in parallel with exploration of alternative beta-cell sources, graft sites, and ultimately fully vascularized bioengineered insulin-secreting microtissues, differentiation status immunostaining provides a novel tool to assess whether fully mature beta-cell phenotype has been maintained.","type+1+diabetes"],["Erratum to: Understanding and preventing type 1 diabetes through the unique working model of TrialNet.",["Battaglia M","Anderson MS","Buckner JH","Geyer SM","Gottlieb PA","Kay TWH","Lernmark A","Muller S","Pugliese A","Roep BO","Greenbaum CJ","Peakman M"],"Diabetologia. 2017 Sep 26. doi: 10.1007/s00125-017-4446-5.","","type+1+diabetes"],["Incidence and Mortality Rates and Clinical Characteristics of Type 1 Diabetes among Children and Young Adults in Cochabamba, Bolivia.",["Duarte Gomez E","Gregory GA","Castrati Nostas M","Middlehurst AC","Jenkins AJ","Ogle GD"],"J Diabetes Res. 2017;2017:8454757. doi: 10.1155/2017/8454757.

Therefore it is important to seek alternative medicine. Chinese medicine Ginseng and Astragalus granule (GAG) was used to successfully treat type 2 diabetes mellitus in clinic in China. Here we found that GAG ameliorated T1DM in autoimmune NOD mice by increasing the level of insulin and reducing the level of blood glucose. Treatments with both GAG and CsA further decreased the blood glucose level. Moreover, GAG increased both CD4+FoxP3+ and CD8+CD122+PD-1+ Treg numbers in both spleens and lymph nodes of NOD mice.

The percentage of effector/memory CD8+ T cells (CD44highCD62Llow) was significantly reduced by GAG, especially in the presence of low-doses of CsA. Histopathology also showed that GAG attenuated cellular infiltration and lowered CD3+ T cell numbers around and in islets. Thus, we demonstrated that GAG ameliorated autoimmune T1DM by upregulating both CD4+FoxP3+ and CD8+CD122+PD-1+ Tregs while GAG synergized with CsA to further suppress autoimmunity and T1DM by reversing the decline in CD4+FoxP3+ Tregs resulted from CsA treatments.

The HbA1c Translator modeling approach was used to calculate the financial impact of these changes. RESULTS: The average cost of inaccuracy associated with the entire group of BGM systems was pound155 per patient year (PPY). The average additional cost of BGM systems not meeting the ISO 15197:2003 standard was an estimated pound178 PPY more than an average system that fulfills the standard and an estimated pound235 PPY more than an average system that appears to meet the ISO 15197:2013 standard. CONCLUSION: There is a clear relationship between BGM system accuracy and cost, with the highest costs being associated with BGM systems not meeting the ISO 15197:2003 standard. Lower costs are associated with systems meeting the ISO 15197:2013 system accuracy criteria. Using BGM systems that meet the system accuracy criteria of the ISO 15197:2013 standard can help reduce the clinical and financial consequences associated with inaccuracy of BGM devices.","type+1+diabetes"],["Day-to-Day and Within-Day Variability in Glucose-Lowering Effect Between Insulin Degludec and Insulin Glargine (100 U/mL and 300 U/mL): A Comparison Across Studies.",["Heise T","Kaplan K","Haahr HL"],"J Diabetes Sci Technol. 2017 Sep 1:1932296817731422. doi: 10.1177/1932296817731422.","BACKGROUND: Insulin degludec (IDeg) has significantly lower day-to-day and within-day variability compared to insulin glargine (IGlar) 100U/mL (U100) and 300U/mL (U300). Here, we report post hoc assessments to confirm the robustness of these observations while accounting for potential experimental confounders. METHODS: Two euglycemic clamp studies in type 1 diabetes patients, comparing IDeg to IGlar-U100 (Study A, parallel design, 54 patients; Study B, crossover, 22 patients) and one study comparing IDeg to IGlar-U300 (Study C, crossover, 57 patients), all dosed at 0.4U/kg, were evaluated. Pharmacodynamic parameters were assessed at steady state from glucose infusion rate (GIR) profiles following three 24-hour euglycemic clamps in Studies A (162 clamps) and C (342 clamps), and one 42-hour clamp in Study B (44 clamps). RESULTS: Pooled data (Studies A and B) showed that IDeg had an even distribution of glucose-lowering effect over the 24-hour dosing interval that was consistent with Study C. IGlar-U100 showed a constant decrease in glucose-lowering effect over 24 hours while IGlar-U300 had a lower effect in the middle of the dosing interval (6-18 hours). Relative within-day variability of IDeg was 40% and 37% lower than IGlar-U100 and -U300, respectively. Exclusion of profiles with low response in Study C (19/342 clamps) did not impact the difference in the distribution of glucose-lowering effect or within-day variability. Day-to-day variability was significantly lower with IDeg compared to IGlar-U100 and -U300 based on smoothed and unsmoothed GIR data. CONCLUSIONS: Significantly lower relative within-day and day-to-day variability was confirmed irrespective of experimental considerations for IDeg compared to IGlar-U100 and IGlar-U300.","type+1+diabetes"],["Inequalities in glycaemic control, hypoglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis according to socio-economic status and area-level deprivation in Type 1 diabetes mellitus: a systematic review.",["Lindner LME","Rathmann W","Rosenbauer J"],"Diabet Med. 2017 Sep 25. doi: 10.1111/dme.13519.","AIM: The aim of this systematic review was to examine the associations of individual-level as well as area-level socio-economic status and area-level deprivation with glycaemic control, hypoglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis in people with Type 1 diabetes mellitus.

Search results were screened by title, abstract and keywords to identify eligible publications. Decisions on inclusion or exclusion of full texts were made independently by two reviewers. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to estimate the methodological quality of included studies. Quality assessment and extracted data of included studies were synthesized narratively and reported according to the PRISMA statement. RESULTS: Literature search in Ovid MEDLINE identified 1345 eligible studies. Twenty studies matched our inclusion and exclusion criteria. Two articles were additionally identified through hand search. According to the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, most of the studies were of average quality. Results on associations of socio-economic status and area-level deprivation with glycaemic control and hypoglycaemia were contradictory between studies. By contrast, lower socio-economic status and higher area-level deprivation were associated with a higher risk for diabetic ketoacidosis in all except one study. CONCLUSIONS: Lower socio-economic status and higher area-level deprivation are associated with a higher risk of experiencing diabetic ketoacidosis in people with Type 1 diabetes mellitus.

Currently, interstitial glucose results may not be used. The aim of this study was to determine whether interstitial glucose measurements using flash glucose-sensing technology can provide additional information to augment safe driving. METHODS: Sensor data from two European studies (NCT02232698 and NCT02082184) of the FreeStyle Libre Glucose Monitoring System in insulin-treated Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, 241 and 224 participants respectively, were used to determine the frequency of a low interstitial sensor glucose result (< 3.9 mmol/l) up to 4 h subsequent to a daytime (07:00-21:00 h) capillary blood glucose result >/= 5 mmol/l. RESULTS: Within 4 h of a capillary blood glucose result >/= 5 mmol/l a sensor glucose result of < 3.9 mmol/l occurred on 22.0% of occasions (2573 of 11 706 blood glucose readings) for those with Type 1 diabetes, and 8.4% of occasions (699/8352) for those with Type 2 diabetes; 13.8% (1610/11 628) and 4.4% (365/8203) within 2 h, and 10.0% (1160/11 601) and 3.1% (254/8152) within 1.5 h.

The aim of the present study was to illustrate the use of a \"rebate table\" to improve the transparency and utility of published budget impact analyses in the US by modeling ranges of hypothetical rebates for two comparators. Worked examples were conducted to illustrate the budgetary implications of using insulin degludec (IDeg) relative to insulin glargine (IGlar) U100 in patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes. METHODS: A short-term (1-year) budget impact model was developed to evaluate the costs of switching to IDeg from IGlar in patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes on basal-bolus and basal-only insulin, respectively. The analysis used insulin dose and hypoglycemia data from recent randomized trials, data on the prevalence of diabetes, and estimates of the proportion of patients using each insulin regimen. The model was configured to run multiple rebate scenarios to generate a rebate table in a hypothetical 1 million member commercial plan. RESULTS: Relative to IGlar, IDeg resulted in reductions in non-severe and severe hypoglycemia incidence and costs both in patients with type 1 and patients with type 2 diabetes. Insulin acquisition costs were higher, and respective rebates of 7.3% and 10.6% were required for IDeg to break-even with IGlar at the full list price. Incremental per member per month IDeg costs without a rebate were USD 0.04 in type 1 diabetes and USD 0.80 in type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Using IDeg instead of IGlar at list price could result in a modest increase in costs when considering insulin and hypoglycemia costs alone, but modest incremental rebates with IDeg would result in cost neutrality relative to IGlar. In addition, IDeg would result in reduced incidence of severe and non-severe hypoglycemia.","type+1+diabetes"],["Type 1 Diabetes - A Clinical Perspective.",["Kahanovitz L","Sluss PM","Russell SJ"],"Point Care. 2017 Mar;16(1):37-40. doi: 10.1097/POC.0000000000000125.","Type 1 diabetes is a disease in which autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta-cells leads to insulin deficiency.

In this work, we investigate the effect of a structured hyper/hypoglycemic metabolic challenge on the postintervention glucose variability in T1D subjects studied at home. METHODS: Thirty T1D subjects using insulin pump were monitored with blood glucose meters (SMBG) during a 1-month observation period. After 2 weeks of monitoring, participants were admitted at the University of Virginia Clinical Research Unit to undergo an 8-hour metabolic challenge. The intervention was designed to create hyperglycemia shortly followed by hypoglycemia, mimicking a real-life scenario of underbolused meal followed by overcorrection. After the intervention, subjects were monitored for 2 more weeks. Glycemic variability was assessed before and after the challenge using the low blood glucose index (LBGI). Glucagon counterregulation (GCR) response to induced hypoglycemia was also measured. LBGI variation and GCR were linked to prior exposure to hypoglycemia. RESULTS: Subjects significantly exposed to hypoglycemia in the 2 weeks before the intervention had a significant increase of postchallenge LBGI ( P < .001) and lower GCR response ( P < .05). Recent occurrence of hypoglycemia and number of years not using an insulin pump were identified as significant predictors of postchallenge LBGI ( P < .001). CONCLUSION: Glycemic swings, a common result of suboptimal insulin treatment, have a significant impact on future (days) glycemic control in T1D subjects with a recent history of hypoglycemia, as measured in the field.

RECENT FINDINGS: Accumulated data suggest that the gut microbiota is involved at two different steps in the evolution of type 1 diabetes. At the first step, the intestinal tract is colonized by a microbial community unable to provide an adequate education of the immune system. As a consequence, the infant acquires susceptibility to immune-mediated diseases, type 1 diabetes included. At the other step, the young child seroconverts to positivity for diabetes-associated autoantibodies. This is preceded or accompanied by a decrease in the diversity of the intestinal microbiota and an increased abundance of Bacteroides species. These changes will affect the disease process promoting progression toward overt type 1 diabetes. By providing specific probiotics, one can affect the colonization of the intestinal tract in the newborn infant or strengthen the immune education in early life. Human milk oligosaccharides function as nutrients for \"healthy\" bacteria. Dietary interventions applying modified starches can influence the numbers and activities of both autoreactive and regulatory T cells and provide protection against autoimmune diabetes in non-obese diabetic mice.

T1D is caused by inflammation-induced loss of insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells, leading to high blood glucose and a host of downstream complications. Although multiple genes are associated with T1D risk, only 5% of genetically susceptible individuals actually develop clinical disease. Moreover, a growing number of T1D cases occur in geographic clusters and among children with low risk genotypes. These observations suggest that environmental factors contribute to T1D etiology. One potential factor, supported primarily by epidemiological studies, is the presence of nitrate and nitrite in drinking water. To test this hypothesis, female hatchling alligators were exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of nitrate in their tank water (reference, 10mg/L, or 100mg/L NO3-N) from hatch through 5 weeks or 5 months of age. At each time point, endpoints related to T1D were investigated: plasma levels of glucose, triglycerides, testosterone, estradiol, and thyroxine; pancreas, fat body, and thyroid weights; weight gain or loss; presence of immune cells in the pancreas; and pancreatic beta cell number, assessed by antibody staining of nkx6.1 protein. Internal dosing of nitrate was confirmed by measuring plasma and urine nitrate levels and whole blood methemoglobin. Cluster analysis indicated that high nitrate exposure (most animals exposed to 100mg/L NO3-N and one alligator exposed to 10mg/L NO3-N) induced a profile of endpoints consistent with early T1D that could be detected after 5 weeks and was more strongly present after 5 months. Our study supports epidemiological data correlating elevated nitrate with T1D onset in humans, and highlights nitrate as a possible environmental contributor to the etiology of T1D, possibly through its role as a nitric oxide precursor.","type+1+diabetes"],["Gestational respiratory infections interacting with offspring HLA and CTLA-4 modifies incident beta-cell autoantibodies.",["Lynch KF","Lee HS","Torn C","Vehik K","Krischer JP","Larsson HE","Haller MJ","Hagopian WA","Rewers MJ","She JX","Simell OG","Toppari J","Ziegler AG","Akolkar B","Hyoty H","Bonifacio E","Lernmark A"],"J Autoimmun. 2017 Sep 20. pii: S0896-8411(17)30558-9. doi: 10.1016/j.jaut.2017.09.005.","beta-cell autoantibodies against insulin (IAA), GAD65 (GADA) and IA-2 (IA-2A) precede onset of childhood type 1 diabetes (T1D).

The incorporation of emerging data on cardiovascular outcomes in FDA drug labels is expected to influence the way physicians treat patients with diabetes.","type+1+diabetes"],["Serum Insulin Bioassay Reflects Insulin Sensitivity and Requirements in Type 1 Diabetes.",["Janssen JAMJL","Llaurado G","Varewijck AJ","Groop PH","Forsblom C","Fernandez-Veledo S","van den Dungen ESR","Vendrell J","Hofland LJ","Yki-Jarvinen H"],"J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2017 Oct 1;102(10):3814-3821. doi: 10.1210/jc.2017-00892.","Context: Insulin resistance could increase insulin requirements in type 1 diabetes (T1D). Current insulin immunoassays do not detect insulin analogs. Kinase insulin receptor (IR) activation (KIRA) bioassays specific for human IR isoforms A (IR-A) and B (IR-B) permit assessment of all circulating insulin bioactivity. We studied whether IR-A and IR-B KIRA assays are related to direct measures of insulin sensitivity or insulin doses in T1D. Design: We evaluated 31 adult patients with T1D (age 45.7 +/- 1.6 years, body mass index 28.8 +/- 0.7 kg/m2). Serum IR-A and IR-B bioactivities were measured by KIRA bioassays. Insulin sensitivity of glucose production (Ra) was measured by the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp technique in which a low insulin dose (0.4 mU/kg/min for 240 minutes) was combined with D-[3-3H] glucose infusion to measure rates of Ra and utilization and insulin action on antilipolysis from suppression of serum free fatty acids. Results: Baseline circulating IR-A bioactivity was 53 +/- 7 pmol/L, and IR-B bioactivity was 81 +/- 11 pmol/L. Compared with baseline, insulin infusion significantly increased IR-A (P < 0.001) and IR-B (P < 0.001) bioactivities. Fasting IR-A and IR-B bioactivities were positively related to endogenous Ra (r = 0.44, P = 0.01 and r = 0.38, P < 0.05). Fasting IR-A (r = 0.43, P = 0.02) and IR-B (r = 0.47, P = 0.01) bioactivities were significantly correlated with insulin requirements and glycosylated hemoglobin (IR-A: r = 0.52, P = 0.002; IR-B: r = 0.48, P = 0.006). Conclusions: Circulating IR-A and IR-B bioactivities are associated with insulin resistance, high insulin requirements, and poor glycemic control in T1D. Measurement of IR bioactivity by KIRA assays provides a tool to assess the amount of biologically active insulin in groups of T1D patients treated with insulin analogs.","type+1+diabetes"],["Pancreatic Histopathology of Human Monogenic Diabetes Due to Causal Variants in KCNJ11, HNF1A, GATA6, and LMNA.",["Sanyoura M","Jacobsen L","Carmody D","Gaudio DD","Alkorta-Aranburu G","Arndt K","Hu YY","Kobiernicki F","Kusmartseva I","Atkinson MA","Philipson LH","Schatz D","Campbell-Thompson M","Greeley SAW"],"J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2017 Aug 16. doi: 10.1210/jc.2017-01159.","Context: Monogenic diabetes is thought to account for 2% of all diabetes cases but most patients are misdiagnosed as type 1 or type 2 diabetes.

Objective: Retrospective study of the JDRF Network for Pancreatic Organ donors with Diabetes biorepository was used to identify possible cases with monogenic diabetes and to compare effects of genetic variants on pancreas histology. Methods: We selected cases with diabetes for genetic testing based on inclusion criteria that included young age at diagnosis, low BMI, negative autoantibody status, and/or detectable C-peptide levels. Samples underwent next-generation targeted sequencing of 140 diabetes/diabetes-related genes. Pancreas weight and histopathology were reviewed. Results: 41/140 cases with diabetes met clinical inclusion criteria, with 38 DNA samples available. Genetic variants of probable clinical significance were found in four cases: one each in KCNJ11, HNF1A, GATA6, and LMNA. The KCNJ11 and HNF1A cases had significantly decreased pancreas weight and insulin mass similar to type 1 diabetes but had no insulitis. The GATA6 sample had severe pancreatic atrophy but with abundant beta-cells and severe amyloidosis similar to type 2 diabetes. The LMNA case had preserved pancreas weight and insulin mass but abnormal islet architecture and exocrine fatty infiltrates. Conclusions: Four cases with diabetes had putative causal variants in monogenic diabetes genes.

The etiology of diabetic nephropathy is multifactorial and both genes and environmental and life style-related factors are involved. In this study, we investigate the effect of the socioeconomic exposures, unemployment and receiving income support, on the development of ESRD in T1D patients, using a marginal structural model (MSM) in comparison with standard logistic regression models. METHODS: The study is based on the Swedish Childhood Diabetes Register which in 1977 started to register patients developing T1D before 15 years of age. In the analyses, we include patients born between 1965 and 1979, developing diabetes between 1977 and 1994, and followed until 2013 (n = 4034). A MSM was fitted to adjust for both baseline and time-varying confounders. RESULTS: The main results of the analysis indicate that being unemployed for more than 1 year and receiving income support are risk factors for the development of ESRD. Multiple exposures over time to these risk factors increase the risk associated with the disease. CONCLUSIONS: Using a MSM is an advanced method well suited to investigate the effect of exposures on the risk of complications of a chronic disease with longitudinal data. The results show that socioeconomic disadvantage increases the risk of developing ESRD in patients with T1D.","type+1+diabetes"],["Complexity of pathomechanisms leading to diastolic heart failure in diabetes mellitus - potential field for therapeutic interventions?",["Schwarzer M","Noutsias M","Spillmann F","Schulze PC","Doenst T","Tschope C"],"BMC Cardiovasc Disord. 2017 Sep 21;17(1):253. doi: 10.1186/s12872-017-0688-x.","Advanced glycation end products (AGE) have been implicated in diabetes associated complications.

Epigenetic and environmental factors capable of altering the penetrance of major susceptibility genes or capable of increasing the penetrance of low-risk genes are currently thought to play a role in triggering autoimmunity and T1D development. This paper discusses the current knowledge of the role of viruses in T1D. Most studies that have evaluated the potential association between viral infections and T1D have indicated that it is highly likely that some of these infectious agents play a role in T1D development. However, most T1D cases are immune-mediated, and it is supposed that the initial viral infection is capable of creating, in genetically predisposed subjects, a particular condition in which chronic local inflammation occurs through the persistence of the infecting virus in pancreatic tissue and the activation of autoimmunity by means of molecular mimicry, bystander activation, or both. Theoretically, this knowledge could lead to possible prophylaxis and therapy for T1D. Further studies devoted to evaluating which infectious agents are linked to T1D and which immune mechanisms induce or protect against the disease are needed before adequate prophylactic and therapeutic measures can be developed.","type+1+diabetes"],["Protective effect of cyanidin-3-O-glucoside on neonatal porcine islets.",["Li C","Yang B","Xu Z","Boivin E","Black M","Huang W","Xu B","Wu P","Zhang B","Li X","Chen K","Wu Y","Rayat GR"],"J Endocrinol. 2017 Dec;235(3):237-249. doi: 10.1530/JOE-17-0141.

However, because few patients with T1D survived to older ages until recently, long-term risks have been unclear. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We examined the 50-year cumulative kidney complication risk in a childhood-onset T1D cohort diagnosed during 1950-80 (n = 932; mean baseline age 29 years, duration 19 years). Participants were 144 who died before baseline, 130 followed with periodic surveys, and 658 followed with biennial surveys and a maximum of nine examinations for 25 years. Micro- and macroalbuminuria were defined as an albumin excretion rate of 20-199 and >/=200 mug/min, respectively, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) as dialysis or kidney transplantation. Cumulative incidence was estimated at 10-year intervals between 20 and 50 years duration and compared by calendar year of diabetes onset. RESULTS: By 50 years of T1D duration, ESRD affected 60% of the cohort; macroalbuminuria, 72%; and microalbuminuria, 88%. Little evidence existed for declines in cumulative incidence in recent cohorts, except for ESRD (microalbuminuria 3% increase, macroalbuminuria no change; ESRD 45% decrease by 40 years of T1D duration). Onset before age 6 years was associated with the lowest risk; incidence generally did not differ by sex. CONCLUSIONS: Some degree of kidney disease in T1D is virtually universal at long durations and not declining, which has major implications for health care and research strategies. ESRD has declined, but continues to affect >25% of the population by 40 years duration.","type+1+diabetes"],["Beta Cell Replacement in Mice Using Human Type 1 Diabetes Nuclear Transfer Embryonic Stem Cells.",["Sui L","Danzl N","Campbell SR","Viola R","Williams D","Xing Y","Wang Y","Phillips N","Poffenberger G","Johannesson B","Oberholzer J","Powers AC","Leibel RL","Chen X","Sykes M","Egli D"],"Diabetes. 2017 Sep 20. pii: db170120. doi: 10.2337/db17-0120.","Beta cells derived from stem cells hold great promise for cell replacement therapy for diabetes.

Risk factors considered were age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation, smoking status, alcohol intake, body mass index, medical conditions, specific drugs, social factors, and results of recent investigations. Measures of calibration and discrimination were determined in the validation cohort for men and women separately and for each age and ethnic group.

Melancholia and atypical depression differ by cortisol secretion and clinical features. The aim was to compare the clinical presentation of T1D and T2D patients in relation to self-reported depression, self-reported anxiety, alexithymia, obesity, and midnight salivary cortisol (MSC). METHODS: Comparative cross-sectional design. The participants were consecutively recruited from one hospital diabetes outpatient clinic: 24 T2D patients (31-59 years) and 148 T1D patients (32-59 years). Self-reported depression, anxiety and alexithymia were assessed by Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale and Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20. MSC, HbA1c, anthropometrics and data from medical records were collected. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: Comparisons of prevalence between diabetes types showed for T2D/T1D: depression 25%/12% (P = 0.10); high MSC (>/=9.3 nmol/L) 38%/22% (P = 0.13); alexithymia 25%/13% (P = 0.12); anxiety 38%/35% (P = 0.82). The prevalence of high MSC did not differ between depressed and non-depressed T2D patients (17% vs. 44%, P = 0.35), but differed between depressed and non-depressed T1D patients (53% vs. 18%, P = 0.003). The alexithymia prevalence differed between depressed and non-depressed T2D patients (67% vs.11%, P = 0.018), and between depressed and non-depressed T1D patients (47% vs. 11%, P < 0.001). The anxiety prevalence did not differ between depressed and non-depressed T2D patients (67% vs. 28%, P = 0.15), but differed between depressed and non-depressed T1D patients (76% vs. 30%, P < 0.001). The obesity prevalence (BMI >/=30 kg/m2) was 83% for depressed T2D patients and 6% for depressed T1D patients. In the T2D patients, depression was associated with alexithymia (Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 15.0).

CONCLUSIONS: The depressed T2D patients had traits of atypical depression, without associated high MSC (>/=9.3 nmol/L) and anxiety, but the association with alexithymia was strong. The depressed T1D patients had traits of melancholia with associated high MSC and anxiety. The obesity prevalence was high in depressed T2D patients and low in depressed T1D patients.","type+1+diabetes"],["Presence of Human Herpesvirus 6B in the Pancreas of Subjects With and Without Type 1 Diabetes.",["Ericsson M","Skog O"],"Pancreas. 2017 Nov/Dec;46(10):1341-1346. doi: 10.1097/MPA.0000000000000927.","OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to investigate the presence of human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6) A and B in human pancreata and to search for signs of active infection in this organ of subjects with and without type 1 diabetes (T1D).

Anthropometric and clinical measurements were obtained through standardized techniques. Fasting and postprandial plasma glucose and glycated hemoglobin(A1c) were estimated before and after initiation of AGP. RESULTS: Overall, there was a significant decrease in A1c both in cases and controls; however, the magnitude of reduction was higher among cases (1% vs.0.7%; P < 0.001).The overall reduction in A1c among cases was higher in T2D (9.2% to 8.3%) compared with T1D (9.6% to 9.4%); however, the absolute difference in A1c reduction between cases and controls was higher among T1D (0.5% vs. 0.2%) patients. The reduction in glycemic parameters was irrespective of age or gender (P for trend <0.001) across all study sites. The greatest reductions in A1c were noted within 6 months of AGP initiation. Multiple logistic regression showed that those who did not use AGP had a 1.42 higher risk (95% CI: 1.24-1.64) of not achieving even 0.1% reduction in A1c compared with those who were initiated on AGP even after adjusting for age, gender, body-mass index, systolic blood pressure, time to follow-up A1c, and medication use. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that FCGM-based AGP with FreeStyle LibrePro is associated with significant reductions in A1c levels in both T1D and T2D.

Type 1 diabetes also leads to impaired glucagon production by the pancreatic alpha-cells, which acts as a counter-regulatory hormone to insulin. A closed-loop system for automatic insulin and glucagon delivery, also referred to as an artificial pancreas, has the potential to reduce the self-management burden of type 1 diabetes and reduce the risk of hypo- and hyperglycemia. To date, bihormonal closed-loop systems for glucagon and insulin delivery have been based on two independent controllers. However, in physiology, the secretion of insulin and glucagon in the body is closely interconnected by paracrine and endocrine associations. In this work, we present a novel biologically-inspired glucose control strategy that accounts for such coordination. An in silico study using an FDA-accepted type 1 simulator was performed to evaluate the proposed coordinated control strategy compared to its non-coordinated counterpart, as well as an insulin-only version of the controller. The proposed coordinated strategy achieves a reduction of hyperglycemia without increasing hypoglycemia, when compared to its non-coordinated counterpart.","type+1+diabetes"],["Association between interferon-induced helicase (IFIH1) rs1990760 polymorphism and seasonal variation in the onset of type 1 diabetes mellitus.",["Jermendy A","Szatmari I","Korner A","Szabo AJ","Toth-Heyn P","Hermann R"],"Pediatr Diabetes. 2017 Sep 20. doi: 10.1111/pedi.12569.","BACKGROUND: Infections, mostly of viral origin, may contribute to the seasonal variation in the onset of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). The rs1990760 (A>G, Ala946Thr) polymorphism (GG genotype) of the interferon induced helicase (IFIH1), a virus recognition receptor, confers a modest protection for T1DM. The aim of our study was to evaluate a possible association between this IFIH1 polymorphism and the seasonal variation in the onset of T1DM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The IFIH1 rs1990760 polymorphism was genotyped in 1055 patients of Central-Eastern European ancestry with T1DM (median age at diagnosis: 8.2 [interquartile range, IQR 4.8-11.8] years). T1DM onset was recorded in monthly intervals. RESULTS: The IFIH1 genotype distribution was the following: 436 patients (41.3%) had AA genotype, 483 patients (45.8%) had AG genotype, and 136 patients (12.9%) had GG genotype. Significant seasonal variation in manifestation of T1DM (highest rate in winter and lowest rate in summer period) was observed in the total cohort (n = 1055), irrespective of gender. The disease predisposing AA genotype was more frequently found among new cases with onset in summer vs in those with onset in winter (44.3% vs 37.9%); conversely, the protective GG genotype was less frequent (9.3% vs 12.9%, respectively; P = .0268 for trend). Significant effect of genotype (P = .0418) was found on the seasonal variability of T1DM onset in the total cohort. CONCLUSIONS: The IFIH1 rs1990760 polymorphism seems to be associated with the seasonal manifestation of T1DM. Our findings suggest that this virus receptor gene may contribute to T1DM manifestation primarily in the summer period.","type+1+diabetes"],["Prefronto-temporal white matter microstructural alterations 20 years after the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus.",["Yoon S","Kim J","Musen G","Renshaw PF","Hwang J","Bolo NR","Kim JE","Simonson DC","Weinger K","Ryan CM","Lyoo IK","Jacobson AM"],"Pediatr Diabetes. 2017 Sep 20. doi: 10.1111/pedi.12574.","OBJECTIVE: Microvascular pathophysiology that uniquely manifests as white matter (WM) abnormalities is often implicated in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM)-related central nervous system (CNS) complications. This study sought to identify regional WM abnormalities in young adults diagnosed with T1DM and further examine their association with cognitive and emotional dysfunction. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Diffusion tensor images (DTI) obtained from 34 young adults with T1DM for >/=15 years (mean duration, 20.9 years), and 16 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects were analyzed using tract-based spatial statistics. Fractional anisotropy (FA) values of the whole brain were analyzed, and their associations with memory function and depressive symptoms were assessed. RESULTS: Whole brain voxel-wise analyses showed that T1DM-related FA reductions were most prominent within the fronto-temporo-parietal regions of the brain. Reduced FA values in the bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculi, at which group differences were most prominent, correlated with lower working memory performance in young adults with T1DM (left, P < .001; right, P = .009). Subsyndromal depressive symptoms were also associated with lower FA values in the right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (P = .004). CONCLUSION: Widespread WM microstructural abnormalities in the fronto-temporo-parietal brain regions, which are associated with emotional and cognitive dysfunction, may be a contributing factor to the neural mechanisms underlying T1DM-related CNS complications, thus affecting the quality of life in young adults with T1DM.","type+1+diabetes"],["Possible Long-Term Efficacy of Sitagliptin, a Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 Inhibitor, for Slowly Progressive Type 1 Diabetes (SPIDDM) in the Stage of Non-Insulin-Dependency: An Open-Label Randomized Controlled Pilot Trial (SPAN-S).",["Awata T","Shimada A","Maruyama T","Oikawa Y","Yasukawa N","Kurihara S","Miyashita Y","Hatano M","Ikegami Y","Matsuda M","Niwa M","Kazama Y","Tanaka S","Kobayashi T"],"Diabetes Ther. 2017 Sep 19. doi: 10.1007/s13300-017-0299-7.","INTRODUCTION: We tested the hypothesis that dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors are effective in preserving the beta-cell function for long-term periods in patients with slowly progressive type 1 diabetes (SPIDDM) or latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA). METHODS: In the present open-label, randomized, controlled trial, 14 non-insulin-requiring diabetic patients with glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibodies (GADAb) were randomly assigned to receive either sitagliptin (S group) or pioglitazone (P group). As a historical control, the Tokyo Study, in which non-insulin-dependent patients with SPIDDM were assigned to receive treatment by either insulin or sulfonylurea (SU), was used. RESULTS: On average, the summation operatorC-peptide values during the oral glucose tolerance test through the follow-up periods showed a nonsignificant increase in the S group (n = 6, n = 5 at 48 months) compared to the P group (n = 5, n = 2 at 48 months). In comparison to the data in the Tokyo Study, treatment by sitagliptin significantly influenced the longitudinal changes in the summation operatorC-peptide values with a more increased direction than insulin or SU, especially in patients with 48 months of follow-up (p = 0.014 and p = 0.007, respectively). Although the titers of GADAb were not significantly different between the S and P groups during the study, the change ratio of the GADAb titers from baseline was significantly inversely correlated with the change ratio of the summation operatorC-peptide values from baseline in the S group (p = 0.003); in particular, when the GADAb titers decreased from baseline, the summation operatorC-peptide values frequently increased. CONCLUSION: The present pilot trial suggests that treatment of SPIDDM/LADA by sitagliptin, a DPP-4 inhibitor, may be more effective in preserving the beta-cell function than insulin treatment for at least 4 years, possibly through the immune modulatory effects of DPP-4 inhibitors.

However, over the last few decades, the frequency of C-section delivery in medium- and high-income countries has rapidly increased worldwide. This review describes the evolution of this procedure in Latin American countries, showing that today more than half of newborns in the region are delivered by C-section. Given that C-section delivery is more expensive than vaginal delivery, its use has increased more rapidly in the private than the public sector; nevertheless, the prevalence of C-section deliveries in the public sector is higher than the WHO's recommendations and continues to increase, representing a growing challenge for Latin America. Although the medium- and long-term consequences of C-section delivery, as opposed to vaginal delivery, on the infant health are unclear, epidemiological studies suggest that it is associated with higher risk of developing asthma, food allergy, type 1 diabetes, and obesity during infancy. These findings are important, as the incidence of these diseases in the Latin American pediatric population is also increasing, particularly obesity. Although the link between these diseases and delivery mode remains controversial, recent studies indicate that the establishment of the gut microbiota is delayed in infants born by C-section during the postnatal period, i.e., during a critical developmental window for the maturation of the newborn's immune system. This delay may favor the subsequent development of inflammatory and metabolic disorders during infancy. Accordingly, from a public health perspective, it is important to slow down and eventually reverse the pattern of increased C-section use in the affected populations.","type+1+diabetes"],["Multiple educational programs improves glycemic control, quality of life with diminishing the impact of diabetes in poorly controlled type 1 diabetics.",["Vyas C","Dalal L","Talaviya P","Saboo B"],"Diabetes Metab Syndr. 2017 Apr 12. pii: S1871-4021(17)30084-X. doi: 10.1016/j.dsx.2017.04.011.","AIMS: The aim of present study was to assess the outcomes of multiple educational programs on glycemic control, quality of life and impact of diabetes in poorly controlled Type 1 Diabetic patients.

Our aim was to examine the effectiveness of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) on maternal glucose control and obstetric and neonatal health outcomes. METHODS: In this multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial, we recruited women aged 18-40 years with type 1 diabetes for a minimum of 12 months who were receiving intensive insulin therapy. Participants were pregnant (</=13 weeks and 6 days' gestation) or planning pregnancy from 31 hospitals in Canada, England, Scotland, Spain, Italy, Ireland, and the USA. We ran two trials in parallel for pregnant participants and for participants planning pregnancy. In both trials, participants were randomly assigned to either CGM in addition to capillary glucose monitoring or capillary glucose monitoring alone. Randomisation was stratified by insulin delivery (pump or injections) and baseline glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c). The primary outcome was change in HbA1c from randomisation to 34 weeks' gestation in pregnant women and to 24 weeks or conception in women planning pregnancy, and was assessed in all randomised participants with baseline assessments. Secondary outcomes included obstetric and neonatal health outcomes, assessed with all available data without imputation. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01788527. FINDINGS: Between March 25, 2013, and March 22, 2016, we randomly assigned 325 women (215 pregnant, 110 planning pregnancy) to capillary glucose monitoring with CGM (108 pregnant and 53 planning pregnancy) or without (107 pregnant and 57 planning pregnancy). We found a small difference in HbA1c in pregnant women using CGM (mean difference -0.19%; 95% CI -0.34 to -0.03; p=0.0207). Pregnant CGM users spent more time in target (68% vs 61%; p=0.0034) and less time hyperglycaemic (27% vs 32%; p=0.0279) than did pregnant control participants, with comparable severe hypoglycaemia episodes (18 CGM and 21 control) and time spent hypoglycaemic (3% vs 4%; p=0.10). Neonatal health outcomes were significantly improved, with lower incidence of large for gestational age (odds ratio 0.51, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.90; p=0.0210), fewer neonatal intensive care admissions lasting more than 24 h (0.48; 0.26 to 0.86; p=0.0157), fewer incidences of neonatal hypoglycaemia (0.45; 0.22 to 0.89; p=0.0250), and 1-day shorter length of hospital stay (p=0.0091). We found no apparent benefit of CGM in women planning pregnancy. Adverse events occurred in 51 (48%) of CGM participants and 43 (40%) of control participants in the pregnancy trial, and in 12 (27%) of CGM participants and 21 (37%) of control participants in the planning pregnancy trial. Serious adverse events occurred in 13 (6%) participants in the pregnancy trial (eight [7%] CGM, five [5%] control) and in three (3%) participants in the planning pregnancy trial (two [4%] CGM and one [2%] control). The most common adverse events were skin reactions occurring in 49 (48%) of 103 CGM participants and eight (8%) of 104 control participants during pregnancy and in 23 (44%) of 52 CGM participants and five (9%) of 57 control participants in the planning pregnancy trial. The most common serious adverse events were gastrointestinal (nausea and vomiting in four participants during pregnancy and three participants planning pregnancy). INTERPRETATION: Use of CGM during pregnancy in patients with type 1 diabetes is associated with improved neonatal outcomes, which are likely to be attributed to reduced exposure to maternal hyperglycaemia. CGM should be offered to all pregnant women with type 1 diabetes using intensive insulin therapy. This study is the first to indicate potential for improvements in non-glycaemic health outcomes from CGM use.

Panretinal photocoagulation is a cornerstone in its management; however, it may include a range of side effects and complications, one of these being serous retinal detachment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the use of intravitreal injection of bevacizumab for serous retinal detachment after panretinal photocoagulation. CASE PRESENTATION: A 24-year-old Saudi man with poorly controlled type 1 diabetes presented with bilateral progressive proliferative retinopathy in spite of several sessions of panretinal photocoagulation. After one additional such session, he developed bilateral serous retinal detachment and vision loss, which was managed with a single bilateral intravitreal bevacizumab injection. The serous retinal detachment subsided with partial recovery of vision. CONCLUSIONS: Serous retinal detachment after panretinal photocoagulation for proliferative diabetic retinopathy is a rare complication nowadays. In this case, it seems that excessive photocoagulation exceeded the energy-absorbing capacity of the retinal pigment epithelium, leading to a disruption of the blood-retinal barrier. A single injection of bilateral intravitreal bevacizumab was sufficient to control the serous retinal detachment. This effect may have been due to a reduction of vascular leakage resulting from the mechanism of action of this drug. No complications were noted from the injection. Caution should be exerted when attempting bilateral panretinal photocoagulation.","type+1+diabetes"],["Relationship between Optimum Mini-doses of Glucagon and Insulin Levels when Treating Mild Hypoglycaemia in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes - A Simulation Study.",["Ranjan A","Wendt SL","Schmidt S","Madsbad S","Holst JJ","Madsen H","Knudsen CB","Jorgensen JB","Norgaard K"],"Basic Clin Pharmacol Toxicol. 2017 Sep 18. doi: 10.1111/bcpt.12907.","Hypoglycaemia remains the main limiting factor in type 1 diabetes management. We developed an insulin-dependent glucagon dosing regimen for treatment of mild hypoglycaemia based on simulations. A validated glucose-insulin-glucagon model was used to describe seven virtual patients with insulin pump-treated type 1 diabetes. In each simulation, one of ten different and individualized subcutaneous insulin boluses was administered to decrease plasma glucose (PG) from 7.0 to </=3.9 mmol/l. Insulin levels were estimated as ratio of actual to baseline serum insulin concentration (se/ba-insulin), insulin on board (IOB) or percentage of IOB to total daily insulin dose (IOB/TDD). Insulin bolus sizes were chosen to provide pre-defined insulin levels when PG reached 3.9 mmol/l, where one of 17 subcutaneous glucagon boluses was administered. Optimum glucagon bolus to treat mild hypoglycaemia at varying insulin levels was the lowest dose that in most patients caused PG peak between 5.0 and 10.0 mmol/l and sustained PG >/= 3.9 mmol/l for 2 hr after the bolus. PG response to glucagon declined with increasing insulin levels. The glucagon dose to optimally treat mild hypoglycaemia depended exponentially on insulin levels, regardless of how insulin was estimated.

METHODS: Seven participants, aged 22.3 +/- 4.3 years, with T1DM using intensive insulin therapy completed 2 days of data collection. On day 1, participants measured baseline fasting blood glucose (BG) with a glucometer, consumed an 8-ounce Boost(R) beverage (41 grams carbohydrate), administered a bolus of insulin according to the carbohydrate load and fasting BG, and sat quietly, repeating BG measurements 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after consumption. On day 2, participants repeated the protocol, but walked 15 minutes at 50% to 60% maximum heart rate immediately after beverage consumption. RESULTS: The difference between peak and baseline (peak - baseline) BG and incremental glucose area under the curve (iAUC) were lower in all but one participant on the walking compared to the sedentary day. Mean peak - baseline BG was significantly lower on the walking day compared to the sedentary day (6.4 +/- 1.2 vs 14.4 +/- 3.4 mmol/L, respectively, p = 0.016) as was the iAUC, (241.1 +/- 155.8 vs 468.6 +/- 94.5 mmol/L/120 min, respectively, p = 0.031). CONCLUSIONS: Fifteen minutes of postprandial walking can blunt the spike in BG and overall glycemic response to a breakfast beverage in young adults with T1DM and may be an effective and realistic component in the management of T1DM.","type+1+diabetes"],["Gastrointestinal motility in people with type 1 diabetes and peripheral neuropathy.

We reveal distinct subpopulations along the endocrine differentiation path and an early lineage bifurcation toward either polyhormonal cells or beta-like cells. We uncover several similarities and differences with mouse development and reveal that cells can take multiple paths to the same differentiation state, a principle that could be relevant to other systems.

We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin as an add-on to adjustable insulin in patients with inadequately controlled type 1 diabetes. METHODS: DEPICT-1 was a double-blind, randomised, parallel-controlled, three-arm, phase 3, multicentre study done at 143 sites in 17 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18-75 years and had inadequately controlled type 1 diabetes (HbA1c between >/=7.7% and </=11.0% [>/=61.0 mmol/mol and </=97.0 mmol/mol]) and had been prescribed insulin for at least 12 months before enrolment. After an 8 week lead-in period to optimise diabetes management, patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) using an interactive voice response system to dapagliflozin 5 mg or 10 mg once daily, given orally, or matched placebo. Randomisation was stratified by current use of continuous glucose monitoring, method of insulin administration, and baseline HbA1c. The primary efficacy outcome was the change from baseline in HbA1c after 24 weeks of treatment in the full analysis set, which consisted of all randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of study drug. An additional 55 patients who were incorrectly and non-randomly allocated to only dapagliflozin treatment groups were included in the safety analysis set. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02268214; data collection for the present analysis was completed on Jan 4, 2017, and a 28 week extension phase is ongoing. FINDINGS: Between Nov 11, 2014, and April 16, 2016, 833 patients were assigned to treatment groups and included in safety analyses (dapagliflozin 5 mg [n=277] vs dapagliflozin 10 mg [n=296] vs placebo [n=260]; 778 of these patients were randomly assigned and included in the full analysis set for efficacy analyses (259 vs 259 vs 260; difference due to randomisation error affecting 55 patients). Mean baseline HbA1c was 8.53% (70 mmol/mol; SD 0.67% [7.3 mmol/mol]). At week 24, both doses of dapagliflozin significantly reduced HbA1c compared with placebo (mean difference from baseline to week 24 for dapagliflozin 5 mg vs placebo was -0.42% [95% CI -0.56 to -0.28; p<0.0001] and for dapagliflozin 10 mg vs placebo was -0.45% [-0.58 to -0.31; p<0.0001]). Among patients in the dapagliflozin 5 mg (n=277), dapagliflozin 10 mg (n=296), and placebo (n=260) groups, the most common adverse events were nasopharyngitis (38 [14%] vs 36 [12%] vs 39 [15%]), urinary tract infection (19 [7%] vs 11 [4%] vs 13 [5%]), upper respiratory tract infection (15 [5%] vs 15 [5%] vs 11 [4%]), and headache (12 [4%] vs 17 [6%] vs 11 [4%]). Hypoglycaemia occurred in 220 (79%), 235 (79%), and 207 (80%) patients in the dapagliflozin 5 mg, dapagliflozin 10 mg, and placebo groups, respectively; severe hypoglycaemia occurred in 21 (8%), 19 (6%), and 19 (7%) patients, respectively. Adjudicated definite diabetic ketoacidosis occurred in four (1%) patients in the dapagliflozin 5 mg group, five (2%) in the dapagliflozin 10 mg group, and three (1%) in the placebo group.

Following run-in, subjects were randomized (2:1) to faster aspart (n = 25) or insulin aspart (n = 12) for 6 weeks. Primary endpoint was the number of microscopically confirmed episodes of infusion-set occlusions. RESULTS: No microscopically confirmed episodes of infusion-set occlusions were observed in either arm. Seven possible infusion-set occlusions were reported by five subjects (all faster aspart); none were prompted by a plug observed by the subject (prompted by unexplained hyperglycemia [n = 6] or leakage [n = 1]) and none were confirmed.

As repression factors may inhibit differentiation, the efficiency of this process is insufficient for cell transplantation. In this study, we used the mouse insulin 2 (Ins2) promoter sequence and performed a DNA affinity precipitation assay combined with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to identify the transcription factor, chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcriptional factor I (COUP-TFI). Functionally, bmMSCs were reprogrammed into IPCs via COUP-TFI suppression and MafA overexpression. The differentiated cells expressed higher levels of genes specific for islet endocrine cells, and they released C-peptide and insulin in response to glucose stimulation. Transplantation of IPCs into streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice caused a reduction in hyperglycemia. Mechanistically, COUP-TFI bound to the DR1 (direct repeats with 1 spacer) element in the Ins2 promoter, thereby negatively regulating promoter activity. Taken together, the data provide a novel mechanism by which COUP-TFI acts as a negative regulator in the Ins2 promoter. The differentiation of bmMSCs into IPCs could be improved by knockdown of COUP-TFI, which may provide a novel stem cell-based therapy for T1D.","type+1+diabetes"],["Encompassing ATP, DNA, insulin, and protein content for quantification and assessment of human pancreatic islets.",["Qi M","Bilbao S","Forouhar E","Kandeel F","Al-Abdullah IH"],"Cell Tissue Bank. 2017 Sep 15. doi: 10.1007/s10561-017-9659-9.","Islet transplantation has made major progress to treat patients with type 1 diabetes.

Additionally, different mathematical calculations integrating total ATP, DNA, insulin, and protein content were randomly tested under various conditions to predict islet status. The results demonstrated that the ATP assay was efficient and the biomolecules were effectively quantified. Furthermore, the mathematical formula we developed could be optimized to predict islet status.

METHODS: CD45 bright/CD14+/OCN+ cells in the circulating mononuclear blood cell fraction were quantified by flow cytometry and reported as percentage of CD45 bright cells. Mechanisms were studied by inducing OCN expression in human monocytes in vitro. RESULTS: Subjects without history of CVD (n = 16) showed lower levels of OCN+ monocytes than subjects with CVD (n = 14) (13.1 +/- 8.4% vs 19.9 +/- 6.4%, p = 0.02). OCN+ monocytes level was inversely related to total high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels (r = -0.424, p = 0.02), large (r = -0.413, p = 0.02) and intermediate (r = -0.445, p = 0.01) HDL sub-fractions, but not to small HDL.

This action of OxLDL was significantly reduced by the addition of HDL in a concentration dependent manner (p < 0.001). Inhibition of the scavenger receptor B1 reduced the effects of both OxLDL and HDL (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Low OCN+ monocytes levels are associated with lack of CVD in people with long duration T1D. A possible mechanism for the increased OCN+ monocytes could be the elevated levels of oxidized lipids due to diabetes which may be inhibited by HDL.

RECENT FINDINGS: GOF mutations affecting STAT1 result in increased STAT tyrosine phosphorylation and secondarily increased response to STAT1-signaling cytokines, such as interferons. In contrast, STAT3 hyperactivity is not usually related to hyperphosphorylation but rather to increased STAT3-mediated transcriptional activity. In both cases, heterozygous STAT1 and STAT3 GOF mutations trigger a distinct set of genes in target cells that lead to abnormal functioning of antimicrobial response and/or autoimmunity and result in autosomal dominant diseases. SUMMARY: Clinical manifestations of patients with STAT1 GOF are characterized by mucocutaneous candidiasis and recurrent lower tract respiratory infections. In addition, many patients have thyroiditis, type 1 diabetes mellitus, autoimmune cytopenias, cancer or aneurysms. Patients with germline STAT3 GOF mutations have an increased frequency of early-onset multiorgan autoimmunity (i.e. autoimmune enteropathy, type 1 diabetes mellitus, autoimmune interstitial lung disease and autoimmune cytopenias), lymphoproliferation, short stature and, less frequently, severe recurrent infections.

METHODS: Two hundred and forty-two Caucasian patients (13-19 years) consecutively enrolled over a 12-month period in three Regional Pediatric Diabetes Centers in Italy. Demographics, clinical, and laboratory parameters, adherence to lifestyle habits (Mediterranean Diet assessed by KIDMED, Physical Activity levels and sedentary behavior by questionnaire) considered either separately or in cluster, and HRQoL by Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Diabetes Module (PedsQL 3.0 DM) were collected. Metabolic control was determined by HbA1cmean of previous year. RESULTS: Only 15 (6.2%) patients fulfilled the cluster of three healthy lifestyle habits without gender differences (p = 0.353); 62 (25.6%) had 1 unhealthy lifestyle habit, and 165 (68.2%) had >/=2.

In the current study, the effects on glycemic control of taking 7-point SMBG profiles and using a diabetes management system (DMA) on a smartphone were investigated. METHODS: In a 12-week, open-label, multicenter, observational study, 51 patients [26 with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and 25 with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)] were instructed to perform SMBG at least seven times a day using DMA combined with the iBGStar (R) SMBG system. HbA1c was measured at regular visits to the study sites. Patients reviewed and managed their data as well as their treatment on their own and there were no further assistance or treatment recommendations. Adverse events (AEs) were recorded throughout. RESULTS: Overall, mean (SD) change from baseline in HbA1c at week 12 was -0.46 (0.57)% [-5 (6) mmol/mol (p < 0.0001)]. The change in HbA1c was observed in patients with T1DM [-0.27 (0.45)% (-3 [5] mmol/mol; p = 0.0063)] and T2DM [-0.65 (0.62)% (-7 [7] mmol/mol; p < 0.0001)]. The change in HbA1c was not correlated with an increased number of hypoglycemic events (blood glucose less than 55 mg/dL). The majority of AEs were symptomatic hypoglycemic events (42 events; nine patients). CONCLUSIONS: Glycemic control can be improved, without receiving any recommendations or advice on insulin dose, by performing daily 7-point SMBG profiles and using electronic documentation with a smartphone app. These results must be confirmed in a larger controlled trial, but they already strengthen the importance of structured SMBG in diabetes therapy.

This study analyzes the frequency and predictors of hypoglycemia in insulin-treated diabetes in an ambulatory setting. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed to study self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) data for 3 months prior to a patient's HbA1c test. RESULTS: Hypoglycemia occurred more frequently in type 1 than in type 2 diabetes; however, 19% of type 2 diabetes patients did experience at least one episode of severe hypoglycemia. For type 1 diabetes, hypoglycemia had a positive association with glycemic variability and duration of diabetes and a negative association with HbA1c and lowest blood glucose (BG). For type 2 diabetes, a positive association was noted with glycemic variability and a negative association with age and lowest BG. CONCLUSIONS: Delineating factors predisposing to hypoglycemia in type 2 diabetes is difficult. Lower HbA1c is a potential predictor of hypoglycemia in type 1 but not in type 2 diabetes. Longer duration of diabetes for type 1 and younger age for type 2 are associated with more hypoglycemia.

Materials and Methods: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we investigated changes in GH, IGFBP, and IGF-1 bioactivity after intramuscular glucagon administration in 13 lean controls, 11 obese participants, and 13 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). The effect of glucagon on the transcription factor forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) translocation, the transcription of GH/IGF-1 system members, and phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt) was further investigated in vitro. Results: Despite unchanged total IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 levels, glucagon decreased IGF-1 bioactivity in all study groups by increasing IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-2. The reduction in IGF-1 bioactivity occurred before the glucagon-induced surge in GH. In contrast to the transient increase in circulating insulin in obese and lean participants, no change was observed in those with T1DM. In vitro, glucagon dose dependently induced a substantial nuclear translocation of FOXO1 in human osteosarcoma cells and tended to increase IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-2 gene expression in mouse primary hepatocytes, despite absent Akt phosphorylation. Conclusions: Our data point to the glucagon-induced decrease in bioactive IGF-1 levels as a mechanism through which glucagon induces GH secretion. This insulin-independent reduction is related to increased IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-2 levels, which are most likely mediated via activation of the FOXO/mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) pathway.","type+1+diabetes"],["Insights into the Diagnostic Potential of Extracellular Vesicles and Their miRNA Signature from Liquid Biopsy as Early Biomarkers of Diabetic Micro/Macrovascular Complications.",["La Marca V","Fierabracci A"],"Int J Mol Sci. 2017 Sep 14;18(9). pii: E1974. doi: 10.3390/ijms18091974.","Extracellular vesicles (EVs) represent a heterogeneous population of small vesicles, consisting of a phospholipidic bilayer surrounding a soluble interior cargo. Almost all cell types release EVs, thus they are naturally present in all body fluids. Among the several potential applications, EVs could be used as drug delivery vehicles in disease treatment, in immune therapy because of their immunomodulatory properties and in regenerative medicine. In addition to general markers, EVs are characterized by the presence of specific biomarkers (proteins and miRNAs) that allow the identification of their cell or tissue origin. For these features, they represent a potential powerful diagnostic tool to monitor state and progression of specific diseases. A large body of studies supports the idea that endothelial derived (EMPs) together with platelet-derived microparticles (PMPs) are deeply involved in the pathogenesis of diseases characterized by micro- and macrovascular damages, including diabetes. Existing literature suggests that the detection of circulating EMPs and PMPs and their specific miRNA profile may represent a very useful non-invasive signature to achieve information on the onset of peculiar disease manifestations. In this review, we discuss the possible utility of EVs in the early diagnosis of diabetes-associated microvascular complications, specifically related to kidney.","type+1+diabetes"],["Efficacy and safety of alirocumab in insulin-treated individuals with type 1 or type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk: The ODYSSEY DM-INSULIN randomized trial.",["Leiter LA","Cariou B","Muller-Wieland D","Colhoun HM","Del Prato S","Tinahones FJ","Ray KK","Bujas-Bobanovic M","Domenger C","Mandel J","Samuel R","Henry RR"],"Diabetes Obes Metab. 2017 Sep 14. doi: 10.1111/dom.13114.","AIMS: To investigate the efficacy and safety of alirocumab in participants with type 2 (T2D) or type 1 diabetes (T1D) treated with insulin who have elevated LDL cholesterol levels despite maximally tolerated statin therapy. METHODS: Participants at high cardiovascular risk with T2D (n = 441) or T1D (n = 76) and LDL cholesterol levels >/=1.8 mmol/L (>/=70 mg/dL) were randomized 2:1 to alirocumab:placebo administered subcutaneously every 2 weeks, for 24 weeks' double-blind treatment. Alirocumab-treated participants received 75 mg every 2 weeks, with blinded dose increase to 150 mg every 2 weeks at week 12 if week 8 LDL cholesterol levels were >/=1.8 mmol/L. Primary endpoints were percentage change in calculated LDL cholesterol from baseline to week 24, and safety assessments. RESULTS: Alirocumab reduced LDL cholesterol from baseline to week 24 by a mean +/- standard error of 49.0% +/- 2.7% and 47.8% +/- 6.5% vs placebo (both P < .0001) in participants with T2D and T1D, respectively. Significant reductions were observed in non-HDL cholesterol (P < .0001), apolipoprotein B (P < .0001) and lipoprotein (a) (P </= .0039). At week 24, 76.4% and 70.2% of the alirocumab group achieved LDL cholesterol <1.8 mmol/L in the T2D and T1D populations (P < .0001), respectively. Glycated haemoglobin and fasting plasma glucose levels remained stable for the study duration. Treatment-emergent adverse events were observed in 64.5% of alirocumab- vs 64.1% of placebo-treated individuals (overall population). CONCLUSIONS: Alirocumab produced significant LDL cholesterol reductions in participants with insulin-treated diabetes regardless of diabetes type, and was generally well tolerated.

Epub 2017 Sep 14.","AIM: Residual beta-cell function is present at the time of diagnosis with Type 1 diabetes. Preserving this beta-cell function reduces complications. We hypothesized that exercise preserves beta-cell function in Type 1 diabetes and undertook a pilot trial to address the key uncertainties in designing a definitive trial to test this hypothesis. METHODS: A randomized controlled pilot trial in adults aged 16-60 years diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes within the previous 3 months was undertaken. Participants were assigned to control (usual care) or intervention (exercise consultation every month), in a 1 : 1 ratio for 12 months. The primary outcomes were recruitment rate, drop out, exercise adherence [weeks with >/= 150 min of self-reported moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA)], and exercise uptake in the control group. The secondary outcomes were differences in insulin sensitivity and rate of loss of beta-cell function between intervention and control at 6 and 12 months. RESULTS: Of 507 individuals who were approached, 58 (28 control, 30 intervention) entered the study and 41 completed it. Participants were largely white European males, BMI 24.8 +/- 3.8 kg/m2 , HbA1c 75 +/- 25 mmol/mol (9 +/- 2%). Mean level of objectively measured MVPA increased in the intervention group (mean 243 to 273 min/week) and 61% of intervention participants reached the target of >/= 150 min/week of self-reported MVPA on at least 42 weeks of the year. Physical activity levels fell slightly in the control group (mean 277 to 235 min of MVPA/week). There was exploratory evidence that intervention group became more insulin sensitive and required less insulin. However, the rate of loss of beta-cell function appeared similar between the groups, although the change in insulin sensitivity may have affected this. CONCLUSION: We show that it is possible to recruit and randomize people with newly diagnosed Type 1 diabetes to a trial of an exercise intervention, and increase and maintain their exercise levels for 12 months. Future trials need to incorporate measures of greater adherence to exercise training targets, and include more appropriate measures of beta-cell function.

Untreated, it develops into diabetic ketoacidosis, a significant contributor to mortality and morbidity in people with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Little is understood about how patients utilize healthcare resources during ketosis events. This study aimed to identify and quantify healthcare resource utilization and provide estimates of associated costs of ketosis events in T1DM, treated unaided or with healthcare professional (HCP) assistance in the UK. METHODS: Qualitative interviews with adult patients, pediatric carers, and HCPs identified resources used by patients/carers during ketosis events. An online quantitative survey was then used to quantify patients/carers resource use during their/their child's most recent ketosis event, and HCPs estimated patient resource uptake to corroborate the findings. Associated costs estimated from UK data sources were applied to the survey results to calculate the cost of ketosis events in adults and children. RESULTS: Quantitative survey responses from 93 adults, 76 carers, and 52 HCPs were analyzed. Patients and carers monitored ketosis during and following the event with ketone strips and additional glucose strips, and administered treatment comprising insulin and pump set changes where appropriate. Additionally, patients/carers accessed phone services and many received follow-up medical appointments. In total, 70% (n = 65) of adult and 66% (n = 50) of pediatric ketosis events were managed at home, for which resource use costs per event were pound23.87 and pound38.00 respectively. Remaining events were treated in NHS facilities costing pound217.57 per adult and pound352.92 per child. Weighted averages identified that ketosis events cost pound81.98 per adult and pound142.97 per child. Indirect costs from work productivity loss increase these figures to pound225.11 per adult and pound256.88 per child. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare resource use for ketosis events is high in adults and children with T1DM and imposes an underappreciated economic burden for the NHS.

Its management is based on follow-up of overweight and obese patients and on regular glycemic control. This study aimed to analyze overweight, obesity and glycemic control in 2227 patients with different types of diabetes (type 1, 2 and gestational) presenting to the Provincial referral center of diabetes (RCD) in Kenitra, Morocco. METHODS: We conducted a study over the period January-December 2015. Overweight and obesity assessment was performed using Body Mass Index calculator (BMI = weight/height2 (kg/m2). Overweight and obesity were defined by BMI > 25 kg/m2and BMI > 30 kg/m2 respectively; the weight and the height were measured according to World Health Organization's recommendations. Glycemic control was based on glycated hemoglobin levels and fasting blood glucose test. Current guidelines recommend a glycosylated hemoglobin level of 7% and a fasting blood glucose of 0.70g/l - 1.10g/L. RESULTS: The age of patients ranged from 8 months to 80 years, with a prevalence of diabetic patients from the urban environment (74%) compared to those from the rural areas (26%). The entire study population was overweight. The average BMI of women showed a trend toward obesity (BMI approximately 30): (29.21 kg/m2 +/- 3,1) in patients with gestational diabetes and (29.15 kg/m2 +/- 3.2) in patients with type 2 diabetes. Blood sugar levels were above the standards: 8.5% +/- 2.6 > 7% for glycosylated hemoglobin and 1.5 g/L +/- 1.3>1.10g/L for fasting blood glucose. The difference between glycosylated hemoglobin levels between men (8.57% +/- 2.6) and women (8.1% +/- 2.3) were not significant (p > 0.05), it was the same with fasting blood glucose: men (1.44 g/L +/- 1,1) and women (1.43 g/L +/- 1.2). Pearson's correlation coefficients were highly significant (p<0.005); on the one hand between BMI and fasting blood glucose(r = 0.5) and on the other hand between BMI and glycosylated hemoglobin levels (r = 0.4). CONCLUSION: The entire study population had BMI and glycaemic control levels above the standards.

The TEDDY data suggest that non-HLA gene polymorphisms may play a different role in the initiation of autoimmunity than they do in progression to T1D once autoimmunity has appeared. The strength of these associations may be related to the age of the population and the high-risk HLA-DR-DQ subtypes studied.","type+1+diabetes"],["Facilitatory effect of insulin treatment on hepatocellular carcinoma development in diabetes.",["Baba H","Kurano M","Nishida T","Hatta H","Hokao R","Tsuneyama K"],"BMC Res Notes. 2017 Sep 13;10(1):478. doi: 10.1186/s13104-017-2783-6.","BACKGROUND: To evaluate the effect of insulin treatment on the incidence and/or severity of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a mouse model of HCC based on diabetes. METHODS: We recently reported that neonatal streptozotocin (STZ) treatment causes type 1 diabetes and subsequent HCC in ddY, Institute for Animal Reproduction (DIAR) mice. Newborn male DIAR mice were divided into three groups based on STZ and insulin (INS) treatment. STZ was subcutaneously injected (60 mg/g) into the STZ-treated group (DIAR-nSTZ mice, N = 13) and the STZ/insulin-treated group (DIAR-nSTZ/INS mice, N = 20). A physiologic solution was injected into the control group (DIAR-control mice, N = 8) 1.5 days after birth. Insulin was subcutaneously injected into the DIAR-nSTZ/INS mice according to the following protocol: 2 IU/day at 4-5 weeks of age, 3 IU/day at 5-7 weeks of age, and 4 IU/day at 7-12 weeks of age. All mice were fed a normal diet and were subjected to physiological and histopathological assessments at 12 weeks of age. RESULTS: DIAR-nSTZ mice had significantly lower body weight and higher blood glucose levels than DIAR-control mice, whereas no significant differences were observed between DIAR-nSTZ/INS mice and control mice. At 12 weeks of age, lower weight of paratesticular fat and higher levels of total cholesterol, triglyceride, and free fatty acids were observed in DIAR-nSTZ mice compared to DIAR-control mice, whereas there were no significant differences between DIAR-nSTZ/INS mice and DIAR-control mice. In the livers of DIAR-nSTZ mice, HCC was observed in 15% of cases, and dysplastic nodules were observed in 77% of cases. In the livers of DIAR-nSTZ/INS mice, HCC was observed in 39% of cases and dysplastic nodules were observed in 61% of cases (p = 0.011). Moreover, the average tumor size was significantly larger in STZ/INS-treated mice than in STZ-treated mice. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that the expression of ERK1/2, downstream substrates of insulin signaling that activate cell proliferation, was significantly higher in STZ/INS-treated mice compared to STZ-treated mice.

The possible implication of increased morbidity in PCOS for screening and follow-up is uncertain and is reviewed in this article. RECENT FINDINGS: The increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease in PCOS is closely associated with BMI. Women with PCOS should be screened for the elements of the metabolic syndrome upon diagnosis. Measurement of HbA1c and the lipid accumulation product could be important tools to differentiate women with high metabolic risk. The immune function in PCOS is impaired with increased secretion of autoantibodies and increased risk of type 1 diabetes, asthma and thyroid disease. The occurrence of thyroid disease could be modified by BMI and D-vitamin status. Screening for diabetes and thyroid disease is part of routine evaluation for endocrine diseases at baseline in PCOS, whereas the necessity of prospective screening for thyroid disease awaits future studies. Especially obese women with PCOS are at an increased risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, gall bladder disease and endometrial cancer.

Methods In this phase 3, double-blind trial, which was conducted at 133 centers worldwide, we randomly assigned 1402 patients with type 1 diabetes who were receiving treatment with any insulin therapy (pump or injections) to receive sotagliflozin (400 mg per day) or placebo for 24 weeks. The primary end point was a glycated hemoglobin level lower than 7.0% at week 24, with no episodes of severe hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis after randomization. Secondary end points included the change from baseline in glycated hemoglobin level, weight, systolic blood pressure, and mean daily bolus dose of insulin. Results A significantly larger proportion of patients in the sotagliflozin group than in the placebo group achieved the primary end point (200 of 699 patients [28.6%] vs. 107 of 703 [15.2%], P<0.001). The least-squares mean change from baseline was significantly greater in the sotagliflozin group than in the placebo group for glycated hemoglobin (difference, -0.46 percentage points), weight (-2.98 kg), systolic blood pressure (-3.5 mm Hg), and mean daily bolus dose of insulin (-2.8 units per day) (P</=0.002 for all comparisons). The rate of severe hypoglycemia was similar in the sotagliflozin group and the placebo group (3.0% [21 patients] and 2.4% [17], respectively). The rate of documented hypoglycemia with a blood glucose level of 55 mg per deciliter (3.1 mmol per liter) or below was significantly lower in the sotagliflozin group than in the placebo group.

This cross-sectional study sought to compare meal and snacking frequency and corresponding carbohydrate intake among adolescents with intensively-treated type 1 diabetes and healthy peers and to analyze their association with glycemic control among diabetes patients. Methods Nutritional data of 712 11- to <19-year-olds from a nationwide population-based survey on early-onset type 1 diabetes (52.7% boys/men, mean age 15.6 years) were compared with 949 food records of 296 healthy participants in the DONALD cohort study (49.7% boys, mean age 14.4 years) using linear mixed models. Furthermore, the association between eating frequency and/or carbohydrate intake with glycemic control (HbA1c) was analyzed with multiple linear regression models. Results After comprehensive adjustment, diabetes patients had, on average, 4.6 [95% confidence interval 3.6, 5.5] more meals or snacks/week but consumed 75.9 [64.5, 87.3] fewer grams of carbohydrates/day than the comparison group. Diabetes subjects also consumed breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks more frequently but ate fewer carbohydrates at all eating occasions. Total carbohydrate intake and carbohydrate intake at breakfast were associated with higher HbA1c levels, while increased breakfast frequency was associated with lower HbA1c levels. Conclusion Eating frequency and carbohydrate intake differed between adolescents with early-onset type 1 diabetes and non-diabetic peers. The observed associations with glycemic control challenge the concept of a completely unregulated eating frequency and carbohydrate intake for people on intensified insulin therapy.","type+1+diabetes"],["Timing of Meal Insulin and Its Relation to Adherence to Therapy in Type 1 Diabetes.",["Datye KA","Boyle CT","Simmons J","Moore DJ","Jaser SS","Sheanon N","Kittelsrud JM","Woerner SE","Miller KM"],"J Diabetes Sci Technol. 2017 Sep 1:1932296817728525. doi: 10.1177/1932296817728525.","The purpose of this study is to examine timing of meal insulin and further determine whether an association exists between timing of meal insulin and missed meal insulin doses.

METHODS: We conducted a registry-based cohort study involving 2281 women with childhood-onset type 1 diabetes, matched for age and birthplace with women without diabetes: two control participants for each woman with diabetes. We compared the frequencies of termination of pregnancy and sterilisation over a 25 year period between women with type 1 diabetes and women without, and estimated standardised incidence ratios (SIRs). Smoothed age and period effects in the incidence of termination of pregnancy or sterilisation were tested statistically. RESULTS: There were more terminations of pregnancy (SIR 1.67; 95% CI 1.51, 1.86) and sterilisations (SIR 1.69; 95% CI 1.56, 1.83) in women with diabetes than in control women.

These intestinal antigen-specific Tr1 cells have the ability to migrate to the periphery via a variety of chemokine receptors such as CCR4, CCR5, and CCR7 and to suppress proliferation of Th1 cells in the pancreas. The ability of Tr1 cells to cure diabetes in NOD mice required IL-10 signaling, as Tr1 cells could not suppress CD4+ T cells with a dominant-negative IL-10R.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis using the 2002-2014 Nationwide Inpatient Sample databases. Depression and other comorbidities were identified using ICD-9-CM codes. Logistic regression was used to investigate the association between patient characteristics and depression. RESULTS: The rate of depression among patients with type 2 diabetes increased from 7.6% in 2002 to 15.4% in 2014, while for type 1 diabetes the rate increased from 8.7% in 2002 to 19.6% in 2014. The highest rates of depression were observed among females, non-Hispanic whites, younger patients, and patients with five or more chronic comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of comorbid depression among diabetic inpatients in the US is increasing rapidly. Although some portion of this increase could be explained by the rising prevalence of multimorbidity, increased awareness and likelihood of diagnosis of comorbid depression by physicians and better documentation as a result of the increased adoption of electronic health records likely contributed to this trend.","type+1+diabetes"],["Treatment of Type 1 Diabetes: Synopsis of the 2017 American Diabetes Association Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes.",["Chamberlain JJ","Kalyani RR","Leal S","Rhinehart AS","Shubrook JH","Skolnik N","Herman WH"],"Ann Intern Med. 2017 Oct 3;167(7):493-498. doi: 10.7326/M17-1259.

METHODS: A large item-pool (64 items) was drafted based on qualitative data from interviews with 27 adults with Type 1 diabetes. Eleven adults with Type 1 diabetes completed the draft questionnaire (responding to items using a five-point Likert scale), and participated in cognitive debriefing interviews. Based on their feedback, the item-pool was reduced and refined. Adults with Type 1 diabetes (N=898) completed an online survey including the draft stigma questionnaire (41 items) and other validated measures. Psychometric validation included principal components analysis and confirmatory factor analysis (split samples), internal consistency reliability assessment and Spearman's rho correlations. RESULTS: Scale reduction techniques resulted in 19 items (alpha=0.93). An unforced three-factor solution suggested three subscales: Treated Differently (six items, alpha=0.89); Blame and Judgement (six items, alpha=0.88); and Identity Concerns (seven items, alpha=0.89). This was corroborated with a confirmatory factor analysis, which demonstrated reasonable model fit with the three factors; less so for a single-factor model. Satisfactory concurrent, convergent and discriminant validity were demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS: The 19-item Type 1 Diabetes Stigma Assessment Scale is a valid and reliable measure of the perceptions and experiences of Type 1 diabetes stigma.

Endothelial dysfunction is considered the earliest detectable stage of cardiovascular disease (CVD), a major complication of diabetes. Here, we hypothesize that TXNIP may promote endothelial dysfunction seen in Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D). Using a T1D-like rat model, we found that diabetic rats showed significantly higher TXNIP mRNA and protein levels in peripheral blood, compared to their non-diabetic counterparts. Those changes were accompanied by decreased production of nitric oxide (NO) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), concurrent with increased expression of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) in the aortic endothelium. In addition, TXNIP overexpression in primary human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) induced by either high glucose or overexpression of carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP), a major transcriptional activator of TXNIP, promoted early apoptosis and impaired NO bioactivity. The correlation between TXNIP expression levels and endothelial dysfunction suggests that TXNIP may be a potential biomarker for vascular complications in T1D patients.","type+1+diabetes"],["Are estrogens promoting immune modulation and islet protection in type 1 diabetes?",["Mauvais-Jarvis F"],"J Diabetes Complications. 2017 Nov;31(11):1563-1564. doi: 10.1016/j.jdiacomp.2017.07.015.

Here, we assessed G. kola extract ability to prevent the early cognitive and motor dysfunctions observed in this model. Methods Rats made diabetic by single injection of streptozotocin were treated daily with either vehicle solution (diabetic control group), insulin, or G. kola extract from the first to the 6th week post-injection. Then, cognitive and motor functions were assessed using holeboard and vertical pole behavioral tests, and animals were sacrificed.

Methods Acute toxicity was carried out at 2g/kg dose of petroleum ether extract of A. latifolia bark (PEALB), chloroform extract of A. latifolia bark (CEALB) and methanol extract of A. latifolia bark (MEALB) in rats. Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin (STZ, 60mg/kg, i.p.) and it was confirmed at 72 h. Diabetic rats received above extracts at 100 and 200mg/kg doses for 28 days.

Recently, studies have revealed that neutrophils contribute to the early pathological injury to the pancreas, predominantly via the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). To determine whether early intervention targeting NETs with staphylococcal nuclease (SNase) can delay the onset of T1DM, non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice were orally administered recombinant Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) expressing SNase. The results showed that NETs were effectively disrupted by SNase both in vivo and in vitro, leading to a significant decrease in neutrophil-derived circulating free DNA (cf-DNA/NETs), neutrophil elastase (NE), and protease 3 (PR3) in the serum compared with the controls. In addition, SNase effectively regulated the blood glucose levels of NOD mice, and the onset of diabetes was postponed with reduced mortality and morbidity. Recombinant L. lactis also ameliorated inflammation in NOD mice, as evidenced by the remarkable increase in IL-4 and reductions in TNF-alpha and CRP. Moreover, HE staining results showed that L. lactis expressing SNase exerted protective effects on pancreatic islets and relieved inflammation of the small intestine in NOD mice. Hence, the present study indicates that the oral delivery of SNase by L. lactis can effectively prevent T1DM, ameliorate inflammation, and contribute to immunomodulatory balance in NOD mice.","type+1+diabetes"],["Celiac disease in Saudi children.

METHODS: This study used a qualitative, descriptive design and aimed to reveal the experience of mothering a child with diabetes when experiencing burnout. Twenty-one mothers of children with T1DM who were experiencing burnout participated in this study. Data were collected via semi-structured interviews, and content analysis was performed. RESULTS: The main results (latent content of the data) were interpreted in one theme, Mission impossible, an inner feeling derived from an extremely challenging experience of mothering, encompassing involuntary responsibility and constant evaluation. Two sub-themes emerged: Forced to provide extraordinary mothering and Constant evaluation of the mothering. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to monitoring the health of the child with T1DM, it is important for clinicians to pay attention to how mothers experience their daily life in order to support those who are at risk of developing burnout, as well as those who are experiencing burnout. The wellbeing of the mother could influence the wellbeing of the child, as well as the entire family. Further research on perceived parental responsibility, gender differences, psychosocial factors, and burnout is needed.

METHODS: The Hypoglycemia Assessment Tool (HAT) study was a non-interventional, 6-month retrospective and 4-week prospective analysis of hypoglycemic events in 24 countries, using self-assessment questionnaires and diaries among patients with T1DM/T2DM aged >/=18years, using insulin for >12months. This report focuses on prospective data, as they are less prone to recall bias. RESULTS: There were 1153 participants in the Malaysian cohort (114 T1DM; 1039 T2DM). In the prospective period, 50.4% and 33.4% of patients reported >/=1 hypoglycemic events, with estimated rates of 20.3 and 13.1 events per patient-year of exposure in patients with T1DM and T2DM, respectively. 24.8% and 16.1% of patients with T1DM or T2DM, respectively, reported >/=1 nocturnal hypoglycemic event. The majority of patients (96.5%, T1DM; 91.8%, T2DM) knew what hypoglycemia was prior to the study. Impaired awareness was present in 48.0% (T1DM) and 36.9% (T2DM) of patients. In the prospective period, 50% of patients with T1DM or T2DM consulted a doctor or nurse following a hypoglycemia episode. CONCLUSIONS: Half of patients with T1DM and a third of patients with T2DM reported >/=1 hypoglycemic event during the prospective period.

We investigated a nationwide population-based cohort with diabetes diagnosed at age 15-34years. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Of 794 patients registered 1987-1988 in the Diabetes Incidence Study in Sweden (DISS) 444 (56%) patients with retinal photos available for classification of retinopathy participated in a follow-up study 15-19 (median 17) years after diagnosis. Mean age was 42.3+/-5.7years, BMI 26.1+/-4.1kg/m2, 62% were male and 91% had type 1 diabetes. A sub-study was performed in 367 patients with retinal photos from both the 9 and 17year follow up and the risk for development of retinopathy between 9 and 17years of follow up was calculated. RESULTS: After median 17years 324/444 (73%, 67% of T1D and 71% of T2D), had developed any DR but only 5.4% proliferative DR. Male sex increased the risk of developing retinopathy (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2-2.9). In the sub-study obesity (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.04-1.4), hyperglycemia (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.6-3.8) and tobacco use (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.1-7.3) predicted onset of retinopathy between 9 and 17years after diagnosis of diabetes. CONCLUSION: The number of patients with severe retinopathy after 17years of diabetes disease was small. The risk of developing retinopathy with onset between 9 and 17years after diagnosis of diabetes was strongly associated to modifiable risk factors such as glycemic control, obesity and tobacco use.","type+1+diabetes"],["Deep capillary plexus impairment in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus with no signs of diabetic retinopathy revealed using optical coherence tomography angiography.",["Scarinci F","Picconi F","Giorno P","Boccassini B","De Geronimo D","Varano M","Frontoni S","Parravano M"],"Acta Ophthalmol. 2017 Sep 9. doi: 10.1111/aos.13510.","","type+1+diabetes"],["Systematic review and meta-analysis of the efficacy of interventions for people with Type 1 diabetes mellitus and disordered eating.",["Clery P","Stahl D","Ismail K","Treasure J","Kan C"],"Diabet Med. 2017 Sep 8. doi: 10.1111/dme.13509.","AIM: To examine the types of interventions currently available for people with Type 1 diabetes mellitus and their effectiveness. BACKGROUND: The prevalence of disordered eating in people with Type 1 diabetes mellitus is twice that in their counterparts without diabetes, and is associated with worse biomedical outcomes and greater mortality. METHODS: Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Library, PubMed and OpenGrey databases were searched up to August 2016 to identify studies on interventions in people with Type 1 diabetes-associated disordered eating. For the systematic review, intervention components were identified and their effectiveness was examined. For the meta-analysis, the pooled effect sizes of glycaemic control (HbA1c ) between pre- and post-treatment in treatment and comparison groups were calculated using a random effects model. RESULTS: Of 91 abstracts reviewed, six studies met the inclusion criteria, of which three had appropriate data for the meta-analysis (n = 118). The pooled effect size was -0.21 95% CI (-0.58 to 0.16; where negative values represent an improvement in HbA1c levels), indicating no statistically significant improvement in the treatment group compared with comparison group. Inpatient therapy appeared to be the most effective treatment, and this had multiple components including cognitive behavioural therapy, psychoeducation and family therapy. CONCLUSION: Limited or no improvement in glycaemic control and disordered eating symptoms was observed in people with Type 1 diabetes-associated disordered eating who were receiving currently available interventions. The present review suggests that developing an intensive intervention with a joint focus on both disordered eating and diabetes management is needed for this complex patient group.","type+1+diabetes"],["Multipeptide-coupled nanoparticles induce tolerance in 'humanised' HLA-transgenic mice and inhibit diabetogenic CD8+ T cell responses in type 1 diabetes.",["Xu X","Bian L","Shen M","Li X","Zhu J","Chen S","Xiao L","Zhang Q","Chen H","Xu K","Yang T"],"Diabetologia. 2017 Sep 8. doi: 10.1007/s00125-017-4419-8.","AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Induction of antigen-specific immunological tolerance may provide an attractive immunotherapy in the NOD mouse model but the conditions that lead to the successful translation to human type 1 diabetes are limited. In this study, we covalently linked 500 nm carboxylated polystyrene beads (PSB) with a mixture of immunodominant HLA-A*02:01-restricted epitopes (peptides-PSB) that may have high clinical relevance in humans as they promote immune tolerance; we then investigated the effect of the nanoparticle-peptide complexes on T cell tolerance. METHODS: PSB-coupled mixtures of HLA-A*02:01-restricted epitopes were administered to HHD II mice via intravenous injection. The effects on delaying the course of the disease were verified in NOD.beta2m null HHD mice. The diabetogenic HLA-A*02:01-restricted cytotoxic lymphocyte (CTL) responses to treatment with peptides-PSB were validated in individuals with type 1 diabetes. RESULTS: We showed that peptides-PSB could induce antigen-specific tolerance in HHD II mice. The protective immunological mechanisms were mediated through the function of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells, suppressive T cell activation and T cell anergy. Furthermore, the peptides-PSB induced an activation and accumulation of regulatory T cells and CD11c+ dendritic cells through a rapid production of CD169+ macrophage-derived C-C motif chemokine 22 (CCL22). Peptides-PSB also prevented diabetes in 'humanised' NOD.beta2m null HHD mice and suppressed pathogenic CTL responses in people with type 1 diabetes. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our findings demonstrate for the first time the potential for using multipeptide-PSB complexes to induce T cell tolerance and halt the autoimmune process. These findings represent a promising platform for an antigen-specific tolerance strategy in type 1 diabetes and highlight a mechanism through which metallophilic macrophages mediate the early cell-cell interactions required for peptides-PSB-induced immune tolerance.","type+1+diabetes"],["Inhibition of Y1 receptor signaling improves islet transplant outcome.",["Loh K","Shi YC","Walters S","Bensellam M","Lee K","Dezaki K","Nakata M","Ip CK","Chan JY","Gurzov EN","Thomas HE","Waibel M","Cantley J","Kay TW","Yada T","Laybutt DR","Grey ST","Herzog H"],"Nat Commun. 2017 Sep 8;8(1):490. doi: 10.1038/s41467-017-00624-2.","Failure to secrete sufficient quantities of insulin is a pathological feature of type-1 and type-2 diabetes, and also reduces the success of islet cell transplantation. Here we demonstrate that Y1 receptor signaling inhibits insulin release in beta-cells, and show that this can be pharmacologically exploited to boost insulin secretion. Transplanting islets with Y1 receptor deficiency accelerates the normalization of hyperglycemia in chemically induced diabetic recipient mice, which can also be achieved by short-term pharmacological blockade of Y1 receptors in transplanted mouse and human islets. Furthermore, treatment of non-obese diabetic mice with a Y1 receptor antagonist delays the onset of diabetes. Mechanistically, Y1 receptor signaling inhibits the production of cAMP in islets, which via CREB mediated pathways results in the down-regulation of several key enzymes in glycolysis and ATP production. Thus, manipulating Y1 receptor signaling in beta-cells offers a unique therapeutic opportunity for correcting insulin deficiency as it occurs in the pathological state of type-1 diabetes as well as during islet transplantation.Islet transplantation is considered one of the potential treatments for T1DM but limited islet survival and their impaired function pose limitations to this approach. Here Loh et al. show that the Y1 receptor is expressed in beta- cells and inhibition of its signalling, both genetic and pharmacological, improves mouse and human islet function.","type+1+diabetes"],["Metformin Improves Endothelial Function and Reduces Blood Pressure in Diabetic Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats Independent from Glycemia Control: Comparison to Vildagliptin.",["Hamidi Shishavan M","Henning RH","van Buiten A","Goris M","Deelman LE","Buikema H"],"Sci Rep. 2017 Sep 8;7(1):10975. doi: 10.1038/s41598-017-11430-7.","Metformin confers vascular benefits beyond glycemia control, possibly via pleiotropic effects on endothelial function. In type-1-diabetes-mellitus (T1DM-)patients metformin improved flow-mediated dilation but also increased prostaglandin(PG)-F2alpha, a known endothelial-contracting factor. To explain this paradoxical finding we hypothesized that metformin increased endothelial-vasodilator mediators (e.g. NO and EDHF) to an even larger extent. Spontaneously-hypertensive-rats (SHR) display impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation (EDR) involving contractile PGs. EDR was studied in isolated SHR aortas and the involvement of PGs, NO and EDHF assessed. 12-week metformin 300 mg/kg/day improved EDR by up-regulation of NO and particularly EDHF; it also reduced blood pressure and increased plasma sulphide levels (a proxy for H2S, a possible mediator of EDHF). These effects persisted in SHR with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced T1DM. Vildagliptin (10 mg/kg/day), targeting the incretin axis by increasing GLP-1, also reduced blood pressure and improved EDR in SHR aortas, mainly via the inhibition of contractile PGs, but not in STZ-SHR. Neither metformin nor vildagliptin altered blood glucose or HbA1c. In conclusion, metformin reduced blood pressure and improved EDR in SHR aorta via up-regulation of NO and particularly EDHF, an effect that was independent from glycemia control and maintained during T1DM. A comparison to vildagliptin did not support effects of metformin mediated by GLP-1.","type+1+diabetes"],["Maternal treatment with short-chain fatty acids modulates the intestinal microbiota and immunity and ameliorates type 1 diabetes in the offspring.",["Needell JC","Ir D","Robertson CE","Kroehl ME","Frank DN","Zipris D"],"PLoS One. 2017 Sep 8;12(9):e0183786. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0183786. eCollection 2017.","We recently hypothesized that the intestinal microbiota and the innate immune system play key roles in the mechanism of Kilham Rat Virus-induced type 1 diabetes in the LEW1.WR1 rat.

We observed that administration of short-chain fatty acids to rat breeders via drinking water prior to pregnancy and further treatment of the offspring with short-chain fatty acids after weaning led to disease amelioration. In contrast, rats that were administered short-chain fatty acids beginning at weaning were not protected from type 1 diabetes. Short-chain fatty acid therapy exerted a profound effect on the intestinal microbiome in the offspring reflected by a reduction and an increase in the abundances of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes taxa, respectively, on day 5 post-infection, and reversed virus-induced alterations in certain bacterial taxa. Principal component analysis and permutation multivariate analysis of variance tests further revealed that short-chain fatty acids induce a distinct intestinal microbiota compared with uninfected animals or rats that receive the virus only. Short-chain fatty acids downregulated Kilham Rat Virus-induced proinflammatory responses in the intestine. Finally, short-chain fatty acids altered the B and T cell compartments in Peyer's patches.

The majority of patients with adult-onset autoimmune diabetes do not require insulin treatment for at least 6 months after diagnosis. Such patients are defined as having latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA), which is distinct from classic adult-onset T1DM. The extensive heterogeneity of adult-onset autoimmune diabetes is apparent beyond the distinction between classic adult-onset T1DM and LADA. LADA is characterized by genetic, phenotypic and humoral heterogeneity, encompassing different degrees of insulin resistance and autoimmunity; this heterogeneity is probably a result of different pathological mechanisms, which have implications for treatment. The existence of heterogeneous phenotypes in LADA makes it difficult to establish an a priori treatment algorithm, and therefore, a personalized medicine approach is required.

Increased MHP was a general phenotype observed in T cell subsets irrespective of prior antigen exposure, and was not correlated with HbA1C levels, subject age, or duration of diabetes. Elevated T cell MHP was not detected in subjects with type 2 diabetes. T cell MHP was associated with increased activation-induced IFNgamma production, and activation-induced IFNgamma was linked to mitochondria-specific ROS production. T cells from subjects with type 1 diabetes also exhibited lower intracellular ATP levels.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data were available from the Diabetes Management and Impact for Long-term Empowerment and Success (MILES) Youth-Australia Study, a national survey assessing various psychosocial indicators among self-selected National Diabetes Services Scheme registrants. Participants in the current study (n = 537) were (mean +/- SD) 16 +/- 2 years old, had type 1 diabetes for 6 +/- 4 years, and 62% (n = 334) were girls. They completed measures of diabetes distress (PAID-T) and depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire for Adolescents) and self-reported their most recent HbA1c and frequency of self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG). Relationships between the PAID-T and the psychological and clinical variables were examined to identify a clinically meaningful threshold for elevated diabetes distress. ANOVA was used to test whether these variables differed by levels of distress. RESULTS: Two cut points distinguished none-to-mild (<70), moderate (70-90), and high (>90) diabetes distress. Moderate distress was experienced by 18% of adolescents and high distress by 36%. Mean depressive symptoms, self-reported HbA1c, and SMBG differed significantly across the three levels of diabetes distress (all P < 0.001), with moderate-to-large effect sizes. CONCLUSIONS: Using the PAID-T, this study defined two clinically meaningful cut points to distinguish none-to-mild, moderate, and high diabetes distress in adolescents (aged 13-19). Based on these cut points, most respondents experienced at least moderate diabetes distress, which was clinically significant. Establishing thresholds for elevated diabetes distress will aid clinicians and researchers to interpret PAID-T scores, prompt discussion and intervention for those with unmet needs, and enable the effectiveness of interventions to be evaluated.","type+1+diabetes"],["Evidence of disordered calcium metabolism in adolescent girls with type 1 diabetes: An observational study using a dual-stable calcium isotope technique.",["Weber DR","O'Brien KO","Schwartz GJ"],"Bone. 2017 Dec;105:184-190. doi: 10.1016/j.bone.2017.09.001.

Twenty adolescent females with T1D were admitted for a 24-h calcium absorption study using oral (44Ca) and intravenous (42Ca) stable isotopes for determination of percent gastrointestinal calcium absorption and estimated calcium retention. Five out of twenty participants were found to have negative estimated calcium retention. Participants with negative calcium retention had greater urinary calcium excretion [202mg/d (IQR: 178-213)] compared to those with positive calcium retention [101.5mg/d (IQR: 82-122)], p=0.01, but similar calcium intake and percent calcium absorption. With the exception of one outlier, 24-h urine calcium was significantly associated with hemoglobin A1c (Pearson's r=0.55, p=0.02). 50% of participants consumed less than the RDA for calcium; fractional calcium absorption was inversely correlated with calcium intake in participants not meeting the RDA (Spearman's rho -0.65, p=0.04). In conclusion, one-quarter of adolescent girls with T1D were found to have negative estimated calcium retention at a time when bone mineral accrual should be ongoing. This appeared to be the result of excess urinary calcium excretion as opposed to diminished gastrointestinal calcium absorption. Insufficient calcium availability for bone deposition during adolescence could impair bone mineral accrual and contribute to skeletal fragility.

Incidence data were presented as age-standardized incidence rates per 100,000 person-years (PY) with 95% confidence intervals [CI]. Joinpoint regression was used for trend analyses and Poisson regression was used to adjust for the effects of age and sex on the incidence. RESULTS: A total number of 2,092 incident cases of type 1 diabetes (1,109 males; 983 females) were included. The age-standardized incidence rates of type 1 diabetes per 100,000 PY was 7.9 [95%CI 6.8; 8.9] in the period from 1982-1989 and 20.1 [95%CI 14.0; 26.1] in the period from 1999-2014. The yearly increase in incidence over the entire time period (1982-2014) was 4.3% according to the average annual percent change (AAPC) method, and estimated to be 4.4% [95% CI 4.0; 4.8%] using a Poisson regression model adjusting for sex and age group. CONCLUSION: In this study, a significantly increasing incidence of type 1 diabetes was observed after reunification. In future studies it would be interesting to follow up on the question of which environmental and lifestyle factors could be causing the increasing type 1 diabetes incidence.","type+1+diabetes"],["Pediatric diabetes training for healthcare professionals in Europe: Time for change.",["Kime NH","Waldron S","Webster E","Lange K","Zinken K","Danne T","Aschemeier B","Sumnik Z","Cinek O","Raposo JF","Vazeou A","Bratina N","Campbell F"],"Pediatr Diabetes. 2017 Sep 7. doi: 10.1111/pedi.12573.","BACKGROUND: Training for healthcare professionals (HCPs) in Europe who care for children and young people (CYP) with type 1 diabetes and their families is variable depending on the country. Building on the work of SWEET (Better control in Pediatric and Adolescent diabeteS: Working to crEate CEnTers of Reference) and using the German Certified Diabetes Educators (CDEs) curriculum, a European collaboration of pediatric diabetes experts aimed to (1) establish current core elements that should be included in a pediatric diabetes education training course and (2) create a template for a European CDE's training curriculum. METHODS: A qualitative methodology incorporating a survey questionnaire, focus group discussions, individual semi-structured interviews and workshops was employed to explore participants' experiences and opinions. HCPs-pediatric consultants, diabetes nurses, dietitians and psychologists, national and local diabetes leads, academic and education leads and children, and young people with diabetes and families took part in the study. The total number of participants equaled 186. RESULTS: A template for a European Certified Diabetes Educator Curriculum (EU-CDEC) was developed based on the themes that emerged from the participants' expertise and experiences. This provides a model for HCPs' pediatric diabetes training provision. CONCLUSIONS: There is a severe shortage of high quality, standardized training for HCPs across the majority of European countries. Lack of trained HCPs for CYP with diabetes will result in the delivery of suboptimal care and impact on health, wellbeing and clinical and psychological outcomes.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This was a non-interventional multicenter study across Germany recruiting pubertally mature adolescents with type 1 diabetes. Medical records were used to collect information on diabetes duration, treatment, and complications. Participants self-reported sleep quality, timing, chronotype, and social jetlag-a measure of circadian misalignment. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was determined at the time of questionnaire response. We used multivariable linear regression models to examine associations between sleep and glycemic control. RESULTS: A total of 191 patients aged 16.5 years (mean HbA1c 8.0% [64 mmol/mol]) were included in this study. In multivariable adjusted analyses, sleep quality was significantly associated with HbA1c (mean difference; beta = -0.07, P = .05). Stratified analysis indicated that this association might be stronger in boys and also in children with migration background. In contrast, neither sleep duration, sleep debt, chronotype, nor social jetlag was associated with HbA1c . Secondary analyses showed that social jetlag was significantly associated with levels of insulin requirements (mean difference; beta = 0.035, P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that poor sleep quality is associated with increased HbA1c in adolescents with type 1 diabetes and that higher levels of circadian misalignment are associated with increased insulin requirements.

Screening for OSA in patients with diabetes is recommended but the frequency with which this is done in clinical practice is unknown. The objectives of this quality improvement initiative were to identify clinician and patient perceptions regarding OSA and to identify the prevalence of patients at high risk for OSA (HROSA). METHODS: A quality improvement initiative was conducted to query clinicians and patients attending a specialty diabetes clinic regarding attitudes and beliefs related to OSA. The Berlin Questionnaire was embedded in patient questionnaires to identify patients as low risk for OSA (LROSA) or HROSA. RESULTS: 35 clinicians completed questionnaires with >80% agreement that OSA contributed to blood pressure (BP), glycemic control, and diabetes complications and that screening is a shared responsibility with other physicians; but only 17% indicated regular screening due predominantly to insufficient time. Of 107 patients (26 type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and 81 type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)), 30% were aware that OSA could affect diabetes outcomes. The prevalence of known OSA, LROSA, and HROSA was similar in T1DM (15%, 50%, 35%) and T2DM (36%, 33%, 31%, respectively) (p=0.21). 59% of all HROSA patients indicated that OSA screening had never been discussed with them. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that providers, but not patients, are knowledgeable about the importance of OSA screening, but insufficient time is a major barrier to wider screening.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data on 443 (50% female) children <19 years of age, with T1D and attending one of three clinics in East London between January 2005 and December 2015 were included. Linear mixed-effects modeling was used to assess ethnic differences in longitudinal HbA1c trajectories during the first 6 months postdiagnosis (1,028 HbA1c data points), adjusting for sex, age at diagnosis, socioeconomic status and pH at diagnosis. Growth curve modeling was used to plot discrete HbA1c trajectories by ethnicity. RESULTS: Longitudinal modeling revealed that all ethnic minorities had higher mean HbA1c at diagnosis compared with White children and highest in Bangladeshi (9.7 mmol/mol, 95% CI 5.1 to 14.3), Asian-Other (5.8 mmol/mol, 95% CI 2.2 to 9.3) and Somali (5.2 mmol/mol, 95% CI 0.1 to 10.2) children, and these differences persisted over the 6-month period after diagnosis. During the first month, HbA1c decreased on average by 19.6 mmol/mol (95% CI -21 to -18) for all children. Population averaged HbA1c decreased between diagnosis and 4 months, followed by a gradual increase in HbA1c levels (mean difference of -30 mmol/mol between diagnosis and 6 months).

T cells have been proven to be central players in that process. What is surprising, however, is that classic mechanisms of tolerance cannot explain diabetogenesis; alternate mechanisms must now be considered. T cell receptor (TCR) revision is the process whereby T cells in the periphery alter TCR expression, outside the safety-net of thymic selection pressures. This process results in an expanded T cell repertoire, capable of responding to a universe of pathogens, but limitations are that increased risk for autoimmune disease development occurs. Classic T cell costimulators including the CD28 family have long been thought to be the major drivers for full T cell activation. In actuality, CD28 and its family member counterparts, ICOS and CTLA-4, all drive regulatory responses. Inflammation is driven by CD40, not CD28. CD40 as a costimulus has been largely overlooked. When naive T cells interact with antigen presenting cell CD154, the major ligand for CD40, is induced. This creates a milieu for T cell (CD40)-T cell (CD154) interaction, leading to inflammation. Finally, defined pathogenic effector cells including TH40 (CD4+CD40+) cells can express FOXP3 but are not Tregs. The cells loose FOXP3 to become pathogenic effector cells. Each of these mechanisms creates novel options to better understand diabetogenesis and create new therapeutic targets for T1D.","type+1+diabetes"],["Picrorhiza kurroa Enhances beta-Cell Mass Proliferation and Insulin Secretion in Streptozotocin Evoked beta-Cell Damage in Rats.",["Kumar S","Patial V","Soni S","Sharma S","Pratap K","Kumar D","Padwad Y"],"Front Pharmacol. 2017 Aug 22;8:537. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2017.00537. eCollection 2017.","Autoimmune destruction of insulin producing pancreatic beta-cells leads to insulin insufficiency and hyperglycemia in type 1 diabetes mellitus.

Investigations to detect HERV-W-Env in a few other autoimmune diseases were negative, except in type-1 diabetes (T1D).

An extensive immunohistological analysis further revealed a significant correlation between HERV-W-Env expression and macrophage infiltrates in the exocrine part of human pancreata. Such findings were corroborated by in vivo studies on transgenic mice expressing HERV-W-env gene, which displayed hyperglycemia and decreased levels of insulin, along with immune cell infiltrates in their pancreas.

In diabetes, risks for diabetic complications are associated with high average blood glucose levels as measured by HbA1c. Hence, in treating diabetes it is natural to aim at lowering HbA1c to normal or near normal levels. In type 1 diabetes, we refer to this as intensive insulin therapy. Since several different types of drugs are used to treat type 2 diabetes we refer to this as intensive glucose-lowering therapy. The report was commissioned by the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare (NBHW) to provide a foundation for their national guidelines for diabetes care. Within the framework of the NBHW guidelines program, SBU is producing three additional reports addressing patient education in managing diabetes, self-monitoring of blood glucose in noninsulin-treated diabetes, and dietary treatment of diabetes. Conclusions: Intensive insulin therapy for type 1 diabetes is demanding for health services and the patient alike, but reduces the risk for cardiovascular disease and substantially reduces the risk for damage to the retina, kidneys, and nerves. The risk is increased for serious hypoglycemia, which places the greatest limitation on treatment. In many patients, successful intensive therapy should reduce diabetes complications in the long term. Treatment is cost effective. In newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes, intensive glucose-lowering therapy helps reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and serious damage to the retina of the eye. Treatment is relatively simple, and the risks for side effects are small. Successful intensive therapy of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes should reduce such complications in the long term. Treatment is cost effective. In patients who have had type 2 diabetes for 5 to 10 years, or longer, the benefits of intensive glucose-lowering therapy are not uniformly greater than the risks, and the cost effectiveness is not clear. The risk for kidney damage is somewhat reduced. Studies present conflicting findings regarding the risk for cardiovascular diseases. It is important to individualize the treatment goals for these patients and balance the risks of side effects (e.g., serious hypoglycemia) against the risks of late diabetes complications, which increase with the rise in HbA1c. New studies with longer follow-up are urgently needed in this patient group. Results Intensive insulin therapy in type 1 diabetes Microvascular disease: Intensive insulin therapy in type 1 diabetes reduces the risk for complications in the eyes, kidneys, and nerves (microvascular disease). The absolute effect is large, approximately 2 to 3 fewer cases per 10 patients during 7 years of treatment (strong scientific evidence). Cardiovascular disease: Intensive insulin therapy in type 1 diabetes reduces the risk for cardiovascular disease in the long term (limited scientific evidence). Risks / side effects: The risk for serious hypoglycemia increases with intensive insulin therapy for type 1 diabetes (strong scientific evidence). The risks increase substantially, approximately 3 times. Intensive insulin therapy in type 1 diabetes increases the risks for weight gain (strong scientific evidence). Intensive insulin therapy in type 1 diabetes does not appear to affect quality of life during a 6-year period (limited scientific evidence).

Extensive immunisation programmes have eradicated smallpox completely and eliminated polio in all but a handful of countries. Thus, the benefits of immunisation are indisputable. But it is important to critically examine an intervention that is recommended for all infants. Routine immunisation must provide reasonable protection against potentially serious diseases, while the risk of serious adverse events must be low. Experience shows that immunisation coverage tends to decline if there is widespread concern about adverse events. Therefore, a solid body of knowledge is needed. Thus, SBU has been requested to review the published scientific literature regarding some vaccines included in the immunisation programme for children in Sweden. Conclusions The present scientific review and the experience from many years of the routine immunisation programme have shown that:The benefits of immunisation far outweigh the risks of adverse events. Immunisation has virtually eliminated the morbidity and mortality of many diseases previously common among both children and adults. Immunisation with Haemophilus influenzae type b Vaccine: Immunisation with Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine effectively protects against Hib infections, which can be serious (strong scientific evidence). The protective effect lasts at least three years. Immunisation against Hib reduces carriage of Hib in the pharynx of children (limited scientific evidence). Routine immunisation of infants also reduces the frequency of serious Hib infections in unvaccinated individuals, so called herd immunity (limited scientific evidence). There is no data suggesting a causal relationship between Hib conjugate vaccines and serious adverse events such as death, sudden infant death syndrome, seizures, type 1 diabetes mellitus and Guillain-Barre syndrome, a neurological disease. Immunisation with Pertussis Vaccine: Immunisation with pertussis vaccine protects children against pertussis (strong scientific evidence). The protective effect lasts at least 5 years after three or four doses of acellular pertussis vaccine (limited scientific evidence). Routine immunisation programmes that include acellular pertussis vaccine reduce the need of hospitalisation due to pertussis among vaccinated children younger than 2 years of age (limited scientific evidence). There is no evidence of a higher frequency of or deaths from serious bacterial infections after immunisation with acellular pertussis vaccine (strong scientific evidence). The scientific literature provides no substantial indication of a causal relationship between acellular pertussis vaccine and the few serious adverse events described in case reports or in national adverse event reports. Health economic models show that immunisation against pertussis is socioeconomically warranted. However, the cost-benefit ratio varies substantially according to assumptions on incidence of pertussis, vaccine efficacy and percentage of immunised children. Immunisation with Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccine: Combination measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccines currently in use provides protection against all three diseases and their complications (limited scientific evidence). MMR vaccine increases the risk of febrile seizures during the first two weeks after immunisation, when fever commonly occurs, but does not increase the risk of later epilepsy (limited scientific evidence). MMR vaccine does not cause type 1 diabetes or serious infections requiring hospitalisation (limited scientific evidence). MMR vaccine does not cause autism or autism spectrum disorder (limited scientific evidence). Immunisation with Hepatitis B Vaccine: Immunisation with hepatitis B vaccine protects children against hepatitis B (strong scientific evidence). More than 90% of immunised children develop protective antibody levels after the first dose (strong scientific evidence). Serious hypersensitivity reactions have been reported following hepatitis B immunisation, but very rarely. There is insufficient scientific evidence to rule out or confirm an association between hepatitis B immunisation and multiple sclerosis (MS). Available data taken together suggest that there is no such correlation. The literature provides no substantial indication of a causal relationship between hepatitis B vaccine and other serious adverse events described in case reports: death, neurological disease other than MS, arthritis and chronic fatigue syndrome. Health economic models indicate hepatitis B vaccine to be cost-effective from a healthcare perspective. Immunisation Against Tuberculosis: Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine administered during the neonatal period or shortly thereafter protects children against tuberculosis at least until 5 years of age. Protection against all forms of tuberculosis is approximately 75% (moderately strong scientific evidence). Efficacy against disseminated (miliary) tuberculosis and tuberculous meningitis is higher around 75 to 85% (moderately strong scientific evidence). Fatal disseminated BCG infection occurs after BCG immunisation, but very rarely (strong scientific evidence). The risk is approximately 1 case per 100,000 immunised infants. The condition is mainly contracted by children with a rare genetic immunodeficiency disease that also increases the risk for other diseases. To further reduce the risk of this serious but rare adverse event, BCG immunisation in Sweden is deferred till 6 months of age, allowing time to identify infants with this rare immunodeficiency disease and exclude them from BCG immunisation. Adverse Events Following Combination Vaccines: There is no indication of clinically significant differences in the frequency of redness, swelling or fever after administration of vaccines that contain different combinations of the following vaccines: diphtheria (D), tetanus (T), pertussis (Pa), polio (IPV), hepatitis B (HBV) and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) (hexavalent vaccine; DTPa-IPV-HBV/Hib, pentavalent vaccine; DTPa-IPV/Hib, tetravalent vaccine; DTPa-IPV or trivalent vaccine; DTPa) (moderately strong scientific evidence). No evidence is available suggesting a greater frequency of hypotonic hyporesponsive episode or persistent inconsolable crying after administration of combination hexavalent, pentavalent or tetravalent vaccine than trivalent vaccine (DTPa) (limited scientific evidence). The overall literature provides no substantial indication of a causal relationship between immunisation and the very occasional serious adverse events, including death, described in case reports or national adverse event reports (insufficient scientific evidence).","type+1+diabetes"],["",[],"","Educating patients in self-care plays a key role in diabetes treatment and is routinely included in the care of people with diabetes. Patient education can be provided individually or in groups and addresses patients' rights and ability to influence and participate in their own care and treatment. This report summarizes the scientific evidence for individual- and group-based patient education programmes and psychological interventions involving supportive programmes based on congnitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and motivational interviewing methods (Motivational interviewing (MI); adaptations of motivational interviewing (AMI); motivational enhancement therapy (MET)). In this report, when we refer to motivational interviewing or MI methodology, we include one or more of the following three types: MI, AMI and/or MET. These methods are compared with usual care, i.e., the prevailing practice at the care unit in question. Within the framework of the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare's work on national guidelines for diabetes care, SBU was commissioned to provide systematic literature reviews in several important areas. This literature review addresses patient education for people with diabetes. Other SBU reports address intensive glucose-lowering therapy in diabetes, systematic self-monitoring of blood glucose in noninsulin-treated diabetes, and dietary treatment of diabetes. Conclusions: The most important measure for long-term control of mean blood glucose is HbA1C, which is also strongly linked to the prevalence of long-term complications. Group education programs for people with type 2 diabetes, led by people with expertise in the subject matter who are well versed in the educational methods of the programme, can substantially reduce HbA1C after 1 to 2 years. Individual education for people with type 2 diabetes yields a small reduction in HbA1C after 1 year. In estimating socioeconomic costs, SBU found that group education costs more than individual education due to more educational sessions over longer periods and the resulting differences in time and travel costs for participants. However, the costs are low in relation to the effect that group education has on HbA1C. The scientific literature reveals no differences in effects on HbA1C between usual care and motivational interviewing methods (MI, AMI, and MET) in monitoring people with diabetes up to 1 year. It is essential to study the effects on HbA1C and quality of life from both individual- and group-based education in patients with type 1 diabetes. Controlled trials are needed to study the effects on HbA1C and quality of life resulting from behavioural-oriented patient education through support programmes based on cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and motivational interviewing methods.","type+1+diabetes"],["Persistence of Pancreatic Insulin mRNA Expression and Proinsulin Protein in Type 1 Diabetes Pancreata.",["Wasserfall C","Nick HS","Campbell-Thompson M","Beachy D","Haataja L","Kusmartseva I","Posgai A","Beery M","Rhodes C","Bonifacio E","Arvan P","Atkinson M"],"Cell Metab. 2017 Sep 5;26(3):568-575.e3. doi: 10.1016/j.cmet.2017.08.013.","The canonical notion that type 1 diabetes (T1D) results following a complete destruction of beta cells has recently been questioned as small amounts of C-peptide are detectable in patients with long-standing disease.

The proteins that are upregulated in T1D cases include S100A9, S100A8, REG1B, REG3A and C9 amongst others. These proteins have important biological functions, such as inflammation, metabolic regulation, and autoimmunity, all of which are pathways linked to the pathogenesis of T1D. The identified proteins may be involved in T1D development and pathogenesis. Our findings of novel proteins uniquely upregulated in T1D pancreas provides impetus for further investigations focusing on their expression profiles in beta cells/ islets to evaluate their role in the disease pathogenesis. Some of these molecules may be novel therapeutic targets T1D.","type+1+diabetes"],["Programmed cell death-1, PD-1, is dysregulated in T cells from children with new onset type 1 diabetes.",["Granados HM","Draghi A 2nd","Tsurutani N","Wright K","Fernandez ML","Sylvester FA","Vella AT"],"PLoS One. 2017 Sep 6;12(9):e0183887. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0183887. eCollection 2017.","BACKGROUND: Programmed death cell 1 (PD-1) is an inhibitor of T cell activation and is also functionally linked to glycolysis. We hypothesized that PD-1 expression is defective in activated T cells from children with type 1 diabetes (T1D), resulting in abnormal T cell glucose metabolism. METHODS: In this pilot study, we enrolled children with new onset T1D within 2 weeks of diagnosis (T1D), unaffected siblings of T1D (SIBS), unaffected, unrelated children (CTRL), children with new onset, and untreated Crohn disease (CD). We repeated the assays 4-6 months post-diagnosis in T1D (T1D follow up). We analyzed anti-CD3/-CD28-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) subsets for PD-1 expression by flow cytometry at baseline and after 24 h in culture. We measured cytokines in the culture medium by multiplex ELISA and glycolytic capacity with a flux analyzer. RESULTS: We enrolled 37 children. T cells derived from subjects with T1D had decreased PD-1 expression compared to the other study groups. However, in T1D follow-up T cells expressed PD-1 similarly to controls, but had no differences in PBMC cytokine production. Nonetheless, T1D follow up PBMCs had enhanced glycolytic capacity compared to T1D. CONCLUSIONS: Activated T cells from T1D fail to upregulate PD-1 upon T-cell receptor stimulation, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of T1D. T1D follow up PBMC expression of PD-1 normalizes, together with a significant increase in glycolysis compared to T1D. Thus, insulin therapy in T1D children is associated with normal PD1 expression and heightened glycolytic capacity in PBMC.","type+1+diabetes"],["Maternal serum calcitriol during pregnancy and risk of childhood onset type 1 diabetes.",["Sorensen IM","Joner G","Jenum PA","Eskild A","Dahl SR","Stene LC"],"Acta Diabetol. 2017 Sep 5. doi: 10.1007/s00592-017-1045-3.","","type+1+diabetes"],["Circulating adipokines are associated with pre-eclampsia in women with type 1 diabetes.",["Kelly CB","Hookham MB","Yu JY","Lockhart SM","Du M","Jenkins AJ","Nankervis A","Hanssen KF","Henriksen T","Garg SK","Hammad SM","Scardo JA","Aston CE","Patterson CC","Lyons TJ"],"Diabetologia. 2017 Sep 5. doi: 10.1007/s00125-017-4415-z.","AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The incidence of pre-eclampsia, a multisystem disorder of pregnancy, is fourfold higher in type 1 diabetic than non-diabetic women; it is also increased in women with features of the metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance. In a prospective study of pregnant women with type 1 diabetes, we measured plasma levels of adipokines known to be associated with insulin resistance: leptin, fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4), adiponectin (total and high molecular weight [HMW]; also known as high molecular mass), retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4) and resistin and evaluated associations with the subsequent development of pre-eclampsia. METHODS: From an established prospective cohort of pregnant type 1 diabetic women, we studied 23 who developed pre-eclampsia and 24 who remained normotensive; for reference values we included 19 healthy non-diabetic normotensive pregnant women. Plasma adipokines were measured (by ELISA) in stored samples from three study visits (Visit 1- Visit 3) at different gestational ages (mean +/- SD): Visit 1, 12.4 +/- 1.8 weeks; Visit 2, 21.7 +/- 1.4 weeks; and Visit 3, 31.4 +/- 1.5 weeks. All the women were free of microalbuminuria and hypertension at enrolment. All study visits preceded the clinical onset of pre-eclampsia. RESULTS: In all groups, leptin, the ratio of leptin to total or HMW adiponectin, FABP4 concentration, ratio of FABP4 to total or HMW adiponectin and resistin level increased, while total and HMW adiponectin decreased, with gestational age. At Visit 1: (1) in diabetic women with vs without subsequent pre-eclampsia, leptin, ratio of leptin to total or HMW adiponectin, and ratio of FABP4 to total or HMW adiponectin, were increased (p < 0.05), while total adiponectin was decreased (p < 0.05); and (2) in normotensive diabetic vs non-diabetic women, total adiponectin was elevated (p < 0.05). At Visits 2 and 3: (1) the primary findings in the two diabetic groups persisted, and FABP4 also increased in women with subsequent pre-eclampsia (p < 0.05); and (2) there were no differences between the two normotensive groups. By logistic regression analyses after covariate adjustment (HbA1c, insulin kg-1 day-1 and gestational age), the best predictive models for pre-eclampsia were as follows: Visit 1, doubling of leptin, OR 9.0 (p < 0.01); Visit 2, doubling of the leptin:total adiponectin ratio, OR 3.7 (p < 0.05); and Visit 3, doubling of FABP4 concentration, OR 25.1 (p < 0.01). The associations were independent of BMI. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: As early as the first trimester in type 1 diabetic women, adipokine profiles that suggest insulin resistance are associated with subsequent pre-eclampsia, possibly reflecting maternal characteristics that precede pregnancy. These associations persist in the second and third trimesters, and are independent of BMI.

Improved models could identify which human T cells initiate and participate in beta-cell destruction and help define critical target islet autoantigens. We used humanized mice (hu-mice) containing robust human immune repertoires lacking xenogeneic graft-versus-host reactivity to address this question. Hu-mice constructed by transplantation of HLA-DQ8+ human fetal thymus and CD34+ cells into HLA-DQ8-transgenic immunodeficient mice developed hyperglycemia and diabetes after transfer of autologous HLA-DQ8/insulin-B:9-23 (InsB:9-23)-specific T-cell receptor (TCR)-expressing human CD4+ T cells and immunization with InsB:9-23. Survival of the infused human T cells depended on the preexisting autologous human immune system, and pancreatic infiltration by human CD3+ T cells and insulitis were observed in the diabetic hu-mice, provided their islets were stressed by streptozotocin. This study fits Koch's postulate for pathogenicity, demonstrating a pathogenic role of islet autoreactive CD4+ T-cell responses in type 1 diabetes induction in humans, underscores the role of the target beta-cells in their immunological fate, and demonstrates the capacity to initiate disease with T cells, recognizing the InsB:9-23 epitope in the presence of islet inflammation.

Sensor-augmented pump therapy (SAP) is associated with higher acquisition costs but provides additional clinical benefits (e.g. reduced rate of hypoglycemic events) over and above that of CSII alone. The aim of the analysis was to assess the cost-effectiveness of SAP with automated insulin suspension relative to CSII alone in two different groups of patients with type 1 diabetes in Sweden. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analyses were performed using the QuintilesIMS CORE Diabetes Model, with clinical and economic input data derived from published literature. Separate analyses were performed for patients at increased risk of hypoglycemia and for patients with uncontrolled glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) at baseline. Analyses were performed from a societal perspective over a lifetime time horizon. Future costs and clinical outcomes were discounted at 3% per annum. RESULTS: SAP with automated insulin suspension was associated with an incremental gain in quality-adjusted life expectancy versus the CSII of 1.88 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in patients at high risk of hypoglycemia and of 1.07 QALYs in patients with uncontrolled HbA1c at baseline. Higher lifetime costs for SAP with automated insulin suspension resulted in projected incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for the SAP with automated insulin suspension versus CSII of Swedish Krona (SEK) 139,795 [euros (EUR) 14,648] per QALY gained for patients at increased risk for hypoglycemia and SEK 251,896 (EUR 26,395) per QALY gained for patients with uncontrolled HbA1c. In both groups, SAP with automated insulin suspension also reduced the incidence of diabetes-related complications relative to CSII. CONCLUSIONS: In Sweden, SAP with automated insulin suspension likely represents a cost-effective treatment option relative to CSII for the management of patients with type 1 diabetes with a history of severe hypoglycemic events or patients who struggle to achieve good glycemic control despite the use of CSII.

Neuregulin (NRG)-1beta is released from cardiac microvascular endothelial cells and acts as a paracrine factor via the ErbB family of tyrosine kinase receptors expressed in cardiac myocytes to regulate cardiac development and stress responses. Because myocardial NRG-1/ErbB signaling has been documented to be impaired during HF associated with type 1 DM, we examined whether enhancement of NRG-1beta signaling via exogenous administration of recombinant NRG-1beta could exert beneficial effects against post-MI HF in the type 1 diabetic heart. METHODS AND RESULTS: Type 1 DM was induced in male Sprague Dawley rats by a single injection of streptozotocin (STZ) (65 mg/kg). Two weeks after induction of type 1 DM, rats underwent left coronary artery ligation to induce MI. STZ-diabetic rats were treated with saline or NRG-1beta (100 microg/kg) twice per week for 7 weeks, starting 2 weeks before experimental MI. Residual left ventricular function was significantly greater in the NRG-1beta-treated STZ-diabetic MI group compared with the vehicle-treated STZ-diabetic MI group 5 weeks after MI as assessed by high-resolution echocardiography. NRG-1beta treatment of STZ-diabetic MI rats was associated with reduced myocardial fibrosis and apoptosis as well as decreased gene expression of key oxidant-producing enzymes.

Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) provides much richer glycemic trend information, including glycemic slope (GS). How to incorporate this information into dosing decisions remains an open question. METHODS: We examined the relationship between premeal GS and postmeal glycemic excursions in 240 individuals with type 1 diabetes receiving CGM augmented insulin pump therapy. Over 23.5 million CGM values were synchronized with 264 500 meals. CGM values were integrated 2 hours premeal to compute GS and 2 hours postmeal to compute glycemic excursion outcomes. Postmeal hyperglycemia (integrated CGM glucose >180 mg/dL*hr) and postmeal hypoglycemic events (any CGM glucose < 70 mg/dL) were tabulated according to positive/negative premeal GS and according to GS bins commonly displayed as rate-of-change arrows on CGM devices. RESULTS: Positive versus negative premeal GS was associated with a 2.28-fold (95% CI 2.25-2.32) risk of postmeal hyperglycemia. Negative versus positive premeal GS was associated with a 2.36-fold (95% CI 2.25-2.43) increase in one or more postprandial hypoglycemic events.

Physical examination revealed massive hepatomegaly. Laboratory evaluation showed anion-gap metabolic acidosis, ketonuria, and markedly elevated aspartate and alanine amino transaminases (AST = 1,162 IU/L and ALT = 598 IU/L, respectively). Despite resolution of DKA with insulin infusion, transaminases continued to increase (peak AST = 3,725 U/L, ALT = 1,049 U/L) with no signs of liver failure (normal coagulation profile and albumin level).

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of insulin on the mitochondrial GRIM-19 in the hearts of rats with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 1 diabetes. Protein changes of GRIM-19 were evaluated by western blotting and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Furthermore, the effects of insulin on mitochondrial complex I were detected in HeLa cells and H9C2 cardiac myocytes. During the development of diabetic heart disease, the cardiac function did not change within the 8 weeks, but the mitochondrial morphology was altered. The hearts from the rats with STZ-induced diabetes exhibited reduced expression of GRIM-19. Prior to the overt cardiac dilatation, mitochondrial alterations were already present. Following subcutaneous insulin injection, it was demonstrated that GRIM-19 protein was altered, as well as the mitochondrial morphology. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 had an effect on insulin signaling in H9C2 cardiacmyocytes, and decreased the level of GRIM-19 by half compared with that in the insulin group.

The aim is to develop a T1D patient decision simulator usable to perform reliable ISCT. METHODS: The T1D patient decision simulator was developed by connecting the UVA/Padova T1D model, which describes glucose, insulin and glucagon kinetics, with modules describing glucose monitoring devices, like self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), the patient's behavior in making treatment decisions, and insulin administration. The reliability of the simulator was assessed by comparing its predictions with data collected in 44 T1D subjects using the Dexcom G5 Mobile CGM sensor as an adjunct to the Bayer Contour Next USB SMBG device. RESULTS: Metrics like time spent in eu/hypo/hyperglycemia of simulated data well match those observed in subjects.

After an overnight fast, 20-25% of glucose released into the circulation originates from the kidneys through gluconeogenesis. In this post-absorptive state, the kidneys utilize about 10% of all glucose utilized by the body. After glucose ingestion, renal gluconeogenesis increases and accounts for approximately 60% of endogenous glucose release in the postprandial period. Each day, the kidneys filter approximately 180g of glucose and virtually all of this is reabsorbed into the circulation. Hormones (most importantly insulin and catecholamines), substrates, enzymes, and glucose transporters are some of the various factors influencing the kidney's role. Patients with type 2 diabetes have an increased renal glucose uptake and release in the fasting and the post-prandial states. Additionally, glucosuria in these patients does not occur at plasma glucose levels that would normally produce glucosuria in healthy individuals. The major abnormality of renal glucose metabolism in type 1 diabetes appears to be impaired renal glucose release during hypoglycemia.","type+1+diabetes"],["[Prevalence of Dental Caries in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus Treated with Multiple Insulin Injections and that of Individuals without Diabetes].",["Machado D","Coelho A","Paula A","Caramelo F","Carrilho F","Barros L","Batista C","Melo M","Ferreira MM","Carrilho E"],"Acta Med Port. 2017 May 31;30(5):402-408. doi: 10.20344/amp.8050.

The aim of this study is to establish a relationship between dental caries in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus treated with multiple insulin injections and that of individuals without diabetes. It is also an aim to characterize the oral hygiene habits of this population. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An observational clinical study of analytical and cross-sectional nature was conducted. Thirty patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and 30 individuals without diabetes were observed and questioned about information regarding their medical history. Oral examination was conducted according to the standards of the World Health Organization and ICDAS was used for caries detection. Statistical analysis was performed and the significance level was set at 5%. RESULTS: Patients with diabetes mellitus showed similar caries levels to that of individuals without diabetes. Patients with diabetes mellitus had a higher dental plaque index. Only 10% of the patients having episodes of nocturnal hypoglycaemia brush their teeth after glucose intake. DISCUSSION: Although there's some controversy in the literature regarding the prevalence of caries in patients with diabetes mellitus, the results are in agreement with a great number of studies. However, patients with diabetes mellitus have a higher plaque index which can be associated with a higher risk for developing certain oral pathologies. CONCLUSION: No statistically significant association was found between type 1 diabetes mellitus and dental caries.","type+1+diabetes"],["Advances in polymeric islet cell encapsulation technologies to limit the foreign body response and provide immunoisolation.",["Ryan AJ","O'Neill HS","Duffy GP","O'Brien FJ"],"Curr Opin Pharmacol. 2017 Aug 30;36:66-71. doi: 10.1016/j.coph.2017.07.013.","Islet transplantation for the treatment of type 1 diabetes (T1D) is hampered by the shortage of donor tissue and the need for life-long immunosuppression.

Previously, our understanding of the beta-cell specific T cell repertoire was based on studies of autoreactive T cell responses in the peripheral blood of patients at risk for, or with, T1D; more recently, investigations have included immunohistochemical analysis of some T cell specificities in the pancreas from organ donors with T1D. Now, we are able to examine live, islet-infiltrating T cells from donors with T1D. RECENT FINDINGS: Analysis of the T cell repertoire isolated directly from the pancreatic islets of donors with T1D revealed pro-inflammatory T cells with targets of known autoantigens, including proinsulin and glutamic acid decarboxylase, as well as modified autoantigens. We have assayed the islet-infiltrating T cell repertoire for autoreactivity and function directly from the inflamed islets of T1D organ donors. Design of durable treatments for prevention of or therapy for T1D requires understanding this repertoire.","type+1+diabetes"],["Correction: Incidence and prevalence of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) among adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D): a systematic literature review.",[],"BMJ Open. 2017 Sep 1;7(8):e016587corr1. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2017-016587corr1.","","type+1+diabetes"],["Prevalence of lipohypertrophy in insulin-treated diabetes patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis.",["Deng N","Zhang X","Zhao F","Wang Y","He H"],"J Diabetes Investig. 2017 Sep 1. doi: 10.1111/jdi.12742.","AIMS/INTRODUCTION: Insulin-treated diabetes patients are at high risk for lipohypertrophy (LH), but this clinical problem has been overlooked by some medical professionals. In addition, studies differed from each other significantly in regard to the prevalence of LH. The present systematic review aimed to determine pooled prevalence levels of LH among insulin-injecting diabetes patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library and Scopus) were searched for eligible studies from their inception until April 2017, and reference lists were searched manually to identify additional studies. Studies containing data on LH in patients with diabetes mellitus were included. Meta-analysis was carried out with a random effects model. RESULTS: A total of 26 studies with a total of 12,493 participants met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis showed that the pooled prevalence of LH was 38% (95% confidence interval [CI] 29-46%, I2 = 99.1%). The main influence on LH was the type of diabetes mellitus. The pooled prevalence of LH among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus was higher than patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (49%, 95% CI 23-74% vs 34%, 95% CI 19-49%).

We studied whether integrated cell culture and reverse transcription real-time PCR could improve EV detection in blood samples from patients with T1D. METHODS: Blood was collected from 13 patients with T1D. The presence of EV RNA in blood was investigated by using real-time RT-PCR. In addition, plasma and white blood cells (WBC) were inoculated to BGM and Vero cell line cultures. Culture supernatants and cells collected on day 7 and day 14 were tested for EV RNA by real-time RT-PCR. Enterovirus identification was performed through sequencing of the VP4/VP2 region. RESULTS: Enterovirus RNA was detected in blood by using real-time RT-PCR in only one out of 13 patients. The detection of EV RNA in cultures inoculated with clinical samples (plasma and/or WBC) gave positive results in five other patients. The viral loads were low, ranging from 45 to 4420 copies/ng of total RNA. One isolate was successfully identified as coxsackievirus B1.

Microalbuminuria serves as an early indicator of DN risk and a predictor of its progression as well as cardiovascular disease risk in both T1DM and T2DM. Although microalbuminuria remains the gold standard for early detection of DN, it is not a sufficiently accurate predictor of DN risk due to some limitations. Thus, there is a paradigm shift to novel biomarkers which would help to predict DN risk early enough and possibly prevent the occurrence of end-stage kidney disease. These new biomarkers have been broadly classified into glomerular biomarkers, tubular biomarkers, biomarkers of inflammation, biomarkers of oxidative stress, and miscellaneous biomarkers which also include podocyte biomarkers, some of which are also considered as tubular and glomerular biomarkers. Although they are potentially useful for the evaluation of DN, current data still preclude the routine clinical use of majority of them. However, their validation using high-quality and large longitudinal studies is of paramount importance, as well as the subsequent development of a biomarker panel which can reliably predict and evaluate this renal microvascular disease.

METHODS: Since 1995, paediatricians in Wales have compiled a prospective register of incident cases of type 1 diabetes occurring before age 15 years in Wales (the Brecon Cohort). Their subsequent mortality rates were compared with mortality in the general populations of Wales and England using the patient-years exposure method. Causes of death were ascertained from death certificates and from clinicians. RESULTS: The standardised mortality ratio for young people with type 1 diabetes in Wales was 2.91 with no clear evidence of improvement or worsening of mortality risk over time. Most deaths occurred between ages 15 and 30 years although at a slightly younger age than in the general population. There were more deaths with increasing age at diagnosis of diabetes. Ketoacidosis remains the most common cause of death before age 30 years. Hypoglycaemia was difficult to ascertain with certainty but also caused some deaths. In this age group, chronic complications of diabetes were not a cause of mortality.

One approach, the inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs), has been reported to suppress pancreatic islet inflammation and beta-cell apoptosis in vitro. In this report, we demonstrate the efficacy of HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) in vivo. We show that daily administration of BRD3308, an isoform-selective HDAC3 inhibitor, for 2 weeks to female nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice, beginning at 3 weeks of age, followed by twice-weekly injections until age 25 weeks, protects the animals from diabetes. The preservation of beta-cells was due to a significant decrease in islet infiltration of mononuclear cells. Moreover, the BRD3308 treatment increased basal insulin secretion from islets cultured in vitro. All metabolic tissues tested in vehicle- or BRD3308-treated groups showed virtually no sign of immune cell infiltration, except minimal infiltration in white adipose tissue in animals treated with the highest BRD3308 dose (10 mg/kg), providing additional evidence of protection from immune attack in the treated groups. Furthermore, pancreata from animals treated with 10 mg/kg BRD3308 exhibited significantly decreased numbers of apoptotic beta-cells compared with those treated with vehicle or low-dose BRD3308. Finally, animals treated with 1 or 10 mg/kg BRD3308 had enhanced beta-cell proliferation.

We examined demographics, diabetes classification, glycemic control, and insulin use in those with and without pancreatic disease (subcategorized into acute pancreatitis or chronic pancreatic disease) before diabetes diagnosis. Regression analysis was used to control for baseline potential risk factors for poor glycemic control (HbA1c >/=7% [53 mmol/mol]) and insulin requirement. RESULTS: We identified 31,789 new diagnoses of adult-onset diabetes.

Flow cytometry and gene expression analyses were performed to investigate the mechanisms underlying graft acceptance. Agarose-SEK rod implantation led to the formation of granulomatous tissue containing regulatory T cells that suppressed immune reactions against the allogeneic islet grafts.

While evidence shows that female youth with type 1 diabetes are more prone to DEB compared to their peers without diabetes, little is known about male adolescents. METHOD: In a national online survey, adolescents (13-19 years) with type 1 diabetes for >/=1 year completed the Diabetes Eating Problem Survey-Revised (DEPS-R), and the Body Mass Index Silhouette Matching Test (BMI-SMT) and items on binge eating and insulin omission. RESULTS: About 477 adolescents (mean age 16 years; 62% females) completed the DEPS-R and 431 the BMI-SMT. The DEPS-R total score was higher for females than males, with scores for females increasing with age. BMI, HbA1c , insulin omission, and binge-eating frequency were associated moderately with DEPS-R for both genders. On the BMI-SMT, 88% of females wanted to be thinner. Of the males, 76% reported body dissatisfaction; however, only 43% expressed a desire for thinness with the remainder desiring a larger body size.

Given the high levels of self-reported DEB and gender-based patterns of body dissatisfaction, future research needs to examine the effectiveness of routine screening of DEB and consider implementation of stepped care approaches.","type+1+diabetes"],["TSH oscillations in young patients with type 1 diabetes may be due to glycemic variability.",["Bellastella G","Maiorino MI","Scappaticcio L","Casciano O","Petrizzo M","Caputo M","Paglionico VA","Giugliano D","Esposito K"],"J Endocrinol Invest. 2017 Aug 30. doi: 10.1007/s40618-017-0752-5.","PURPOSE: A relationship between thyroid dysfunction and diabetes mellitus has been described by several authors but the role of glycemic variability is still unclear. We planned the present study to evaluate the influence of glycemic variability on thyroid hormones and TSH concentrations in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). METHODS: Seventy-seven young patients with T1DM were enrolled and evaluated for basal glucose concentrations, HbA1c, thyroid hormones and TSH concentrations. Glucose variability was investigated by considering the standard deviation of blood glucose readings and by calculating the mean amplitude of glycemic excursions and continuous overlapping net glycemic action (CONGA). The low (LBGI) and high (HBGI) blood glucose indices were also calculated. The correlations between TSH, thyroid hormones, glycemia and HbA1c were studied in patients and in controls, whereas those between TSH, thyroid hormones and indices of glucose variability only in patients. RESULTS: No correlations were observed in T1DM patients between free thyroid hormones and glycemic values, HbA1c and indices of glucose variability, while an inverse correlation was observed between TSH levels and glycemic values (r = -0.27; p = 0.01), CONGA index (r = -0.35; p = 0.001) and HBGI (r = -0.28; p = 0.01) but not with HbA1c (r = -0.1; p = 0.47). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a direct action of glycemic excursions on TSH secretion, regardless of variations of thyroid hormone concentrations. Thus, the evaluation of thyroid function through the assay of TSH concentrations in these patients should be made, if possible, by multiple samples on patients in euglycemic state to avoid underestimation or overestimation of thyroid dysfunction due to a wrong diagnosis of euthyroidism or dysthyroidism with consequent inappropriate choice of therapeutic options.","type+1+diabetes"],["Retinal thickness as a marker of disease progression in longitudinal observation of patients with Wolfram syndrome.",["Zmyslowska A","Fendler W","Waszczykowska A","Niwald A","Borowiec M","Jurowski P","Mlynarski W"],"Acta Diabetol. 2017 Nov;54(11):1019-1024. doi: 10.1007/s00592-017-1042-6.

The aim of the study was to evaluate retinal parameters by using optical coherence tomography (OCT) in WFS patients after 2 years of follow-up and analysis of the parameters in relation to visual acuity. METHODS: OCT parameters and visual acuity were measured in 12 WFS patients and 31 individuals with type 1 diabetes. RESULTS: Total thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), average retinal thickness and total retinal volume decreased in comparison with previous OCT examination. Significant decreases were noted for RNFL (average difference -17.92 microm 95% CI -30.74 to -0.10; p = 0.0157), macular average thickness (average difference -5.38 microm 95% CI -10.63 to -2.36; p = 0.0067) and total retinal volume (average difference -0.15 mm3 95% CI -0.30 to -0.07; p = 0.0070). Central thickness remained unchanged (average difference 1.5 microm 95% CI -7.61 to 10.61; p = 0.71). Visual acuity of WFS patients showed a strong negative correlation with diabetes duration (R = -0.82; p = 0.0010). After division of WFS patients into two groups (with low-vision and blind patients), all OCT parameters except for the RNFL value were lower in blind WFS patients. CONCLUSIONS: OCT measures structural parameters and can precede visual acuity loss. The OCT study in WFS patients should be performed longitudinally, and serial retinal examinations may be helpful as a potential end point for future clinical trials.","type+1+diabetes"],["Joint modeling of longitudinal autoantibody patterns and progression to type 1 diabetes: results from the TEDDY study.",["Kohler M","Beyerlein A","Vehik K","Greven S","Umlauf N","Lernmark A","Hagopian WA","Rewers M","She JX","Toppari J","Akolkar B","Krischer JP","Bonifacio E","Ziegler AG"],"Acta Diabetol. 2017 Nov;54(11):1009-1017. doi: 10.1007/s00592-017-1033-7.

The level of autoantibody titers is known to be associated with progression time from the first emergence of autoantibodies to the onset of clinical symptoms, but detailed analyses of this complex relationship are lacking. We aimed to fill this gap by applying advanced statistical models. METHODS: We investigated data of 613 children from the prospective TEDDY study who were persistent positive for IAA, GADA and/or IA2A autoantibodies. We used a novel approach of Bayesian joint modeling of longitudinal and survival data to assess the potentially time- and covariate-dependent association between the longitudinal autoantibody titers and progression time to T1D. RESULTS: For all autoantibodies we observed a positive association between the titers and the T1D progression risk. This association was estimated as time-constant for IA2A, but decreased over time for IAA and GADA. For example the hazard ratio [95% credibility interval] for IAA (per transformed unit) was 3.38 [2.66, 4.38] at 6 months after seroconversion, and 2.02 [1.55, 2.68] at 36 months after seroconversion. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that T1D progression risk stratification based on autoantibody titers should focus on time points early after seroconversion. Joint modeling techniques allow for new insights into these associations.","type+1+diabetes"],["Albuminuria Reduction after High Dose of Vitamin D in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus: A Pilot Study.",["Felicio JS","de Oliveira AF","Peixoto AS","de Souza ACCB","Abrahao Neto JF","de Melo FTC","Carvalho CT","de Lemos MN","Cavalcante SDN","Resende FS","Dos Santos MC","Motta AR","Janau LC","Yamada ES","Felicio KM"],"Front Endocrinol (Lausanne). 2017 Aug 14;8:199. doi: 10.3389/fendo.2017.00199. eCollection 2017.","BACKGROUND: Some studies suggest an association between diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and vitamin D (VD), but there is no data about the effect of high dose of VD on DKD in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM).

Closed loop control (CLC) systems (artificial pancreas) improve glycemic control during limited intensity and short duration of physical activity (PA). However, CLC has not been tested during extended vigorous outdoor exercise common among adolescents. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Skiing presents unique metabolic challenges: intense prolonged PA, cold, altitude, and stress/fear/excitement. In a randomized controlled trial, 32 adolescents with T1D (ages 10-16 years) participated in a 5-day ski camp ( approximately 5 h skiing/day) at two sites: Wintergreen, VA and Breckenridge, CO. Participants were randomized to the University of Virginia (UVa)-CLC system or remotely monitored sensor-augmented pump (RM-SAP). The CLC and RM-SAP groups were coarsely paired by age and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). All subjects were remotely monitored 24 h per day by study physicians and clinical team. RESULTS: Compared with physician-monitored open loop, percent time in range (70-180 mg/dL) improved using CLC: 71.3 vs. 64.7% (+6.6% [95% CI 1-12]; P = 0.005), with maximum effect late at night. Hypoglycemia exposure and carbohydrate treatments were improved overall (P = 0.001 and P = 0.007) and during the daytime with strong ski level effects (P = 0.0001 and P = 0.006); ski/snowboard proficiency was balanced between groups but with a very strong site effect: naive in Virginia and experienced in Colorado.

This increase in food consumption contributes to chronic hyperglycaemia in diabetes thus contributing to the development of micro- and macrovascular complications. We have reported that plant-derived oleanolic acid (OA) and maslinic acid (MA) reduce blood glucose levels, in part, through the inhibition of intestinal carbohydrate hydrolyzing enzymes and glucose transporters. However, their effects on food intake and plasma ghrelin concentrations are unclear. Accordingly, we investigated the effects of these triterpenes on food intake and ghrelin expression in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. MATERIAL: The effects of OA and MA on blood glucose concentration; food and water intake were monitored over five weeks after which plasma ghrelin concentrations were measured. Additionally, the expression of ghrelin in the various sections of the GIT was determined using Western blot analysis. RESULTS: Ghrelin concentrations in untreated STZ-induced diabetic rats were significantly higher in comparison to the non-diabetic control. Interestingly, the administration of OA and MA reduced food intake, blood glucose levels and plasma ghrelin levels in STZ-induced diabetic rats. This was further complemented by significant reductions in the gastrointestinal expression of ghrelin suggesting that the anti-diabetic properties of these triterpenes are mediated, in part, through the reduction of food intake and the modulation of ghrelin expression. CONCLUSION: The findings of the study suggest that the control of food intake through the reduction of ghrelin expression by plant-derived OA and MA may constitute an avenue of glycaemic control in diabetes mellitus.","type+1+diabetes"],["Adult neural stem cell dysfunction in the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricle leads to diabetic olfactory defects.",["Jing YH","Qi CC","Yuan L","Liu XW","Gao LP","Yin J"],"Neural Regen Res. 2017 Jul;12(7):1111-1118. doi: 10.4103/1673-5374.211190.","Sensitive smell discrimination is based on structural plasticity of the olfactory bulb, which depends on migration and integration of newborn neurons from the subventricular zone. In this study, we examined the relationship between neural stem cell status in the subventricular zone and olfactory function in rats with diabetes mellitus.

Meanwhile, the number of BrdU-positive and BrdU+/DCX+ double-labeled cells was lower in the subventricular zone of diabetic rats compared with age-matched normal rats. Western blot results revealed downregulated expression of insulin receptor beta, phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase 3beta, and beta-catenin in the subventricular zone of diabetic rats. Altogether, these results indicate that diabetes mellitus causes insulin deficiency, which negatively regulates glycogen synthase kinase 3beta and enhances beta-catenin degradation, with these changes inhibiting neural stem cell proliferation. Further, these signaling pathways affect proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells in the subventricular zone. Dysfunction of subventricular zone neural stem cells causes a decline in olfactory bulb structural plasticity and impairs olfactory sensitivity in diabetic rats.","type+1+diabetes"],["The innate immune receptor MDA5 limits rotavirus infection but promotes cell death and pancreatic inflammation.",["Dou Y","Yim HC","Kirkwood CD","Williams BR","Sadler AJ"],"EMBO J. 2017 Sep 15;36(18):2742-2757. doi: 10.15252/embj.201696273.

MDA5 variants encoded by minor IFIH1 alleles associated with lower T1D risk exhibit reduced activity against rotavirus infection. We find that MDA5 activity limits rotavirus infection not only through the induction of antiviral interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines, but also by promoting cell death. Importantly, this MDA5-dependent antiviral response is specific to the pancreas of rotavirus-infected mice, similar to the autoimmunity associated with T1D.

Having in mind increasingly appreciated role of gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) cells in autoimmunity, especially in relation to gut Th17 and regulatory T (Treg) cells, our aim was to determine if there are differences in proportion of CD4+ T cell populations in mesenteric lymph nodes and Peyer's patches of these mouse strains. Lower proportion of Treg was observed in NOD PP, Th2 cells dominated in BALB/c mice in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) and Peyer's patches (PP), while Th1 cells prevailed in C57BL/6 MLN. Intradermal immunization of mice with complete Freund's adjuvant resulted in significant difference in Th cell distribution in GALT of NOD mice. Differences were less pronounced in C57BL/6 mice, while GALT of BALB/c mice was almost unresponsive to the immunization. The observed strain- and tissue-dependent changes in Treg proportion after the immunization was probably a consequence of different CCR2 or CCR6-related migration patterns and/or in situ Treg proliferation. In conclusion, NOD, a highly autoimmunity-prone mouse strain, exhibits more profound GALT-related immune response upon immunization compared to the strains that are less prone to autoimmunity.","type+1+diabetes"],["PCI Versus CABG in Patients With Type 1 Diabetes and Multivessel Disease.",["Nystrom T","Sartipy U","Franzen S","Eliasson B","Gudbjornsdottir S","Miftaraj M","Lagerqvist B","Svensson AM","Holzmann MJ"],"J Am Coll Cardiol. 2017 Sep 19;70(12):1441-1451. doi: 10.1016/j.jacc.2017.07.744.

OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine if patients with T1D and multivessel disease may benefit from CABG compared with PCI. METHODS: In an observational cohort study, the authors included all patients with T1D who underwent a first multivessel revascularization in Sweden from 1995 to 2013. The authors used the SWEDEHEART (Swedish Web-system for Enhancement and Development of Evidence-based care in Heart disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapies) register, the Swedish National Diabetes Register, and the Swedish National Patient Register to retrieve information about patient characteristics and outcomes. They estimated hazard ratios (HRs) adjusted for confounders with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for all-cause and coronary heart disease mortality, myocardial infarction, repeat revascularization, stroke, and heart failure using inverse probability of treatment weighting based on propensity scores. RESULTS: In total, 683 patients who underwent CABG and 1,863 patients who underwent PCI were included. During a mean follow-up of 10.6 years, 53% of patients in the CABG group and 45% in the PCI group died. PCI, compared with CABG, was associated with a similar risk of all-cause mortality (HR: 1.14; 95% CI: 0.99 to 1.32), but higher risks of death from coronary heart disease (HR: 1.45; 95% CI: 1.21 to 1.74), myocardial infarction (HR: 1.47; 95% CI: 1.23 to 1.78), and repeat revascularization (HR: 5.64; 95% CI: 4.67 to 6.82). No differences in risks of stroke or heart failure were found. CONCLUSIONS: Notwithstanding the inclusion of patients with T1D who might not have been able to undergo CABG in the PCI group we found that PCI, compared with CABG, was associated with higher rates and risks of coronary heart disease mortality, myocardial infarction, and repeat revascularizations.

We showed that most islet-infiltrating Treg cells express inducible T-cell co-stimulator (ICOS) in pre-diabetic NOD mice, and that ICOS+ Treg cells display enhanced fitness and suppressive function in situ. Moreover, T1D progression is associated with decreased expansion and suppressive activity of ICOS+Foxp3+ Treg cells, in islets, an observation consistent with the exacerbated T1D seen in NOD.BDC2.5 mice in which the ICOS pathway is abrogated. Here, we show that a large proportion of islet-resident Treg cells express the KLRG1 marker of terminally differentiation, in contrast to islet-infiltrating ICOS- Treg or Teff cells. We hypothesized that KLRG1 expression designates a subpopulation of ICOS+ Treg cells in islets that progressively loses function, and contributes to the immune dysregulation observed at T1D onset. Indeed, KLRG1-expressing ICOS+ Treg cells are prone to apoptosis, and have an impaired proliferative capacity and suppressive function in vitro and in vivo. T1D protective low-dose IL-2 treatment in vivo could not rescue the loss of KLRG1-expressing Treg cells in situ. While the global pool of Foxp3+ Treg cells displays some degree of functional plasticity in vivo, the KLRG1+ ICOS+ Treg cell subset is particularly susceptible to lose Foxp3 expression and reprogram into Th1- or Th17-like effector T (Teff) cells in the pancreas microenvironment.

The myocardial tissue was examined for histological and ultrastructural alterations. The expression level of iNOS at the transcriptional and translational levels in the myocardial tissue was estimated. The level of FBG was increased in the DM group compared with the NC group, verifying the diabetic condition of the rats. The function of the left ventricle, the myocardial histological alterations and ultrastructures were damaged in the DM group. The DM group additionally demonstrated an increase in the serum NO content and tNOS, iNOS, LDH, CK and CKMB activities. The myocardial MDA, NO content and tNOS levels were additionally increased in this group. The iNOS activity was increased significantly whereas the myocardial SOD activity was decreased. The increase in the iNOS activity was supported by an enhanced expression level of myocardial iNOS mRNA and protein in the DM group. In the DM+PAG group, in the absence of H2S, the dysfunction of the left ventricle and the oxidative stress injury were increased compared with the DM group. The activity and the expression of tNOS and iNOS were increased significantly. However, the rats in the DM+PAG group demonstrated the opposite effects. In conclusion, H2S exhibits a protective effect on the myocardium in type 1 diabetic rats, which may be associated with the suppression of iNOS activity and expression, a decrease in the NO content and the inhibition of oxidative stress injury.","type+1+diabetes"],["Lessons Learned From a Life With Type 1 Diabetes: Adult Perspectives.",["Freeborn D","Dyches T","Roper SO"],"Diabetes Spectr. 2017 Aug;30(3):188-194. doi: 10.2337/ds16-0032.","Adults who have lived much of their life with type 1 diabetes have learned lessons that can benefit health care providers (HCPs), families, and young people who live with the condition.

STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: This is the first examination of ED with repeated measures at an annual resolution, with up to 30 years of responses for each participant. However, the yes vs no response is a limitation because the real phenotype is not binary and the question can be interpreted differently depending on the participant. CONCLUSIONS: Age, glycemic control, and BMI were important longitudinal predictors of ED. We have described a more complex ED phenotype, with variation in remission patterns, which could offer insight into different mechanisms or opportunities for intervention. If validated in other cohorts, such findings could be used to establish more accurate prognostication of outcomes for patients with ED to guide individualized interventions.

To support pivotal clinical studies during biosimilar evaluation, a sensitive, specific and robust liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assay for the simultaneous quantification of glargine and its two active metabolites, M1 and M2 were developed. Strategies to overcome analytical challenges, so as to optimize assay sensitivity and improve ruggedness, were evolved, resulting in a fully validated LC-MS/MS method with a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) at 0.1ng/mL ( approximately 16pM, equivalent to approximately 2.8muU/mL) for glargine, M1 and M2, respectively, using 0.5mL of human plasma. The assay employed hybrid methodology that combined immunoaffinity purification and reversed-phase chromatography followed by electrospray-MS/MS detection operated under positive ionization mode. Stable-isotope labeled 6[D10]Leu-glargine and 4[D10]Leu-M1 were used as internal standards. With a calibration range from 0.1 to 10ng/mL, the intra-run precision (n=5) and accuracy were <6.21%, and 96.9-102.1%, while the inter-run (n=5/run for 7days) precision and accuracy were <9.55% and 96.5-105.1%, respectively, for all 3 analytes. Matrix effect, recovery, analyte stability, and interferences from control matrix, potential concomitant medications and anti-drug antibody were assessed. The assay was fully automated and has been successfully used in support of biosimilar clinical studies. Greater than 94.3% of incurred sample reanalysis (ISR) results met acceptance criteria, demonstrating the robustness of the assay. The strategic considerations during method development and validation are discussed, and can be applied to quantification of other peptides, especially insulin analogs, in the future.","type+1+diabetes"],["Diosmin ameliorates the effects of oxidative stress in lenses of streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetic rats.",["Wojnar W","Kaczmarczyk-Sedlak I","Zych M"],"Pharmacol Rep. 2017 Apr 15;69(5):995-1000. doi: 10.1016/j.pharep.2017.04.005.","BACKGROUND: Diabetic cataractogenesis is a complex process connected with hyperglycemia and oxidative stress. Free radicals induce many unfavorable changes in the activity of the antioxidative enzymes and may also lead to oxidative damage.

METHODS: The study was conducted on the male Wistar rats with streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetes. After the administration of diosmin at the doses of 50 and 100mg/kg for 4 weeks the oxidative stress markers in the lenses of these rats were evaluated. Tested markers included: activity of superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase, as well as levels of total and soluble protein, level of glutathione, vitamin C, advanced oxidation protein products and malonyldialdehyde.

The precise molecular mechanism of STZ cytotoxicity is however not clear. Studies have suggested that STZ is preferably absorbed by insulin-secreting beta-cells and induces cytotoxicity by producing reactive oxygen species/reactive nitrogen species (ROS/RNS). In the present study, we have investigated the mechanism of cytotoxicity of STZ in insulin-secreting pancreatic cancer cells (Rin-5F) at different doses and time intervals. Cell viability, apoptosis, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial bioenergetics were studied. Our results showed that STZ induces alterations in glutathione homeostasis and inhibited the activities of the respiratory enzymes, resulting in inhibition of ATP synthesis. Apoptosis was observed in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Western blot analysis has also confirmed altered expression of oxidative stress markers (e.g., NOS and Nrf2), cell signaling kinases, apoptotic protein-like caspase-3, PARP, and mitochondrial specific proteins. These results suggest that STZ-induced cytotoxicity in pancreatic cells is mediated by an increase in oxidative stress, alterations in cellular metabolism, and mitochondrial dysfunction.

METHODS: Patients (8 to 18 years) with T1D and caregivers completed questionnaires that queried their perceptions of (1) what the A1C level assesses, (2) the ideal A1C target, and (3) the ideal BG range. Point-of-care A1C levels were measured for each patient. They also completed the Self-Care Inventory Revised (SCI-R) to assess adherence to diabetes self-care behaviors. RESULTS: Among 253 dyads, the frequencies of patients compared to caregivers who could accurately describe what the A1C level assesses, identify the ideal A1C target, and identify the ideal BG range were 20 vs. 66, 31 vs. 56, and 72 vs. 76%, respectively.

Two inhibitors recently identified by our groups through screening efforts, ML127 and ML351, have been shown to selectively target 12/15-LOX with high potency. Only ML351 exhibited no apparent toxicity across a range of concentrations in mouse islets, and molecular modeling has suggested reduced promiscuity of ML351 compared with ML127. In mouse islets, incubation with ML351 improved glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in the presence of proinflammatory cytokines and triggered gene expression pathways responsive to oxidative stress and cell death.

Using advanced intravital imaging approaches and newly created reporter mice (Flt3-BFP2, Mertk-GFP-DTR, Cd4-tdTomato, Cd8a-tdTomato), we show that the autoimmune process initiates first with a T cell infiltration into the islets, where they have restricted mobility but reside and are activated in apposition to CX3CR1+ macrophages. The main expansion then occurs in the connective tissue outside the islet, which remains more or less intact. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, Tregs, and dendritic cells (DCs) are highly mobile, going along microvascular tracks, while static macrophages (MF) form a more rigid structure, often encasing the islet cell mass. Transient cell-cell interactions are formed between T cells and both MFs and DCs, but also surprisingly between MFs and DCs themselves, possibly denoting antigen transfer. In later stages, extensive islet destruction coincides with preferential antigen presentation to, and activation of, CD8+ T cells. Throughout the process, Tregs patrol the active compartments, consistent with the notion that they control the activation of many cell types.","type+1+diabetes"],["Case of steroid-responsive encephalopathy from hypoglycaemia.",["Mathur JL","Rajabi F","Schroeder A","Becker TK"],"BMJ Case Rep. 2017 Aug 24;2017. pii: bcr-2017-221262. doi: 10.1136/bcr-2017-221262.","Hypoglycaemic encephalopathy is a feared complication in the management of patients with diabetes mellitus.

We aimed to investigate differences in mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet count, and platelet mass between patients with T1DM, T2DM, and healthy controls and to explore associations between these platelet indices and glucose control. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 691 T1DM and 459 T2DM patients and 943 control subjects (blood donors) were included. HbA1c was measured in all subjects with diabetes and 36 T1DM patients further underwent 24 h-continuous glucose monitoring to estimate short-term glucose control (glucose mean and standard deviation). Adjusting for age and sex, platelet count was higher and MPV lower in both T1DM and T2DM patients vs control subjects, while platelet mass (MPV x platelet count) resulted higher only in T2DM. Upon further adjustment for HbA1c, differences in platelet count and mass were respectively 19.5 x 109/L (95%CI: 9.8-29.3; p < 0.001) and 101 fL/nL (12-191; p = 0.027) comparing T2DM vs T1DM patients. MPV and platelet count were significantly and differently related in T2DM patients vs both T1DM and control subjects; this difference was maintained also accounting for HbA1c, age, and sex. Platelet mass and the volume-count relationship were significantly related to HbA1c only in T1DM patients. No associations were found between platelet indices and short-term glucose control. CONCLUSION: By accounting for confounders and glucose control, our data evidenced higher platelet mass and different volume-count kinetics in subjects with T2DM vs T1DM. Long-term glucose control seemed to influence platelet mass and the volume-count relationship only in T1DM subjects. These findings suggest different mechanisms behind platelet formation in T1DM and T2DM patients with long-term glycaemic control being more relevant in T1DM than T2DM.","type+1+diabetes"],["Risk of atrial fibrillation in people with type 1 diabetes compared with matched controls from the general population: a prospective case-control study.",["Dahlqvist S","Rosengren A","Gudbjornsdottir S","Pivodic A","Wedel H","Kosiborod M","Svensson AM","Lind M"],"Lancet Diabetes Endocrinol. 2017 Oct;5(10):799-807. doi: 10.1016/S2213-8587(17)30262-0.

To our knowledge, the independent association between type 1 diabetes and atrial fibrillation has not been studied. METHODS: We did a prospective case-control study of individuals with type 1 diabetes in the Swedish National Diabetes Registry who were each matched with five controls for age, sex, and county of residence who were randomly selected from the Swedish Population Register. Cases of atrial fibrillation were obtained from the Swedish National Patient Registry. FINDINGS: We followed up 36 258 patients with type 1 diabetes and 179 980 controls between Jan 1, 2001, and Dec 31, 2013. Median follow-up was 9.7 years (IQR 5.2-13.0) for patients and 10.2 years (5.7-13.0) for controls. 749 (2%) individuals with type 1 diabetes and 2882 (2%) controls were diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.13 (95% CI 1.01-1.25; p=0.029) in men and 1.50 (1.30-1.72; p<0.0001) in women (p=0.0019 for interaction). The excess risk of atrial fibrillation in individuals with type 1 diabetes increased with worsening glycaemic control and renal complications. Among individuals with normoalbuminuria, no excess risk of atrial fibrillation was noted in men with type 1 diabetes who had HbA1c lower than 9.7% (<83 mmol/mol) or in women with type 1 diabetes who had HbA1c lower than 8.8% (<73 mmol/mol). INTERPRETATION: Compared with the general population, the risk of atrial fibrillation in men with type 1 diabetes was slightly raised, whereas for female patients it was 50% higher. The risk of atrial fibrillation in people with type 1 diabetes increased with renal complications and poor glycaemic control.

All JEVIN survey data and routine examinations documented in the electronic patient record EMIL(R) of surviving and deceased participants were used for analyses. We compared the data of the surviving with the deceased participants (follow-up time: 2,166 person-years). Results The incidence rate of death was 1.75/100 person-years. Median observation time for all patients was 23.1 years (range 0.61-26.6 years). Mean age at death was 58.5 years (34.2-78.4 years), and diabetes duration 35 years (3.5-68.5 years). Most frequent causes of death were: cardiovascular diseases (48.2%, n=13) and infections (25.9%, n=7).

The alloxan-treated rats with permanent hyperglycemia, which further received i.p. twenty daily doses 2mg/kg b.w. phthalhydrazide, showed at 60days of the experiment a significant amelioration of the diabetes status. Hyperglycemia was decreased by 52%, glycated haemoglobin HbA1c returned to control value, insulin concentration significantly increased from 45,4% (alloxan group) to 59,5% (alloxan+phthalhydrazide) of the control values. Importantly, phthalhydrazide treatment of alloxan-treated diabetic rats markedly decreased the concentrationof interleukin-6 (IL-6) and corticosterone level. Morphometric analysis revealed a marked increase in the number of pancreatic islets/mm2, and a number of cells/mm2 in the pancreatic islets. These changes, including 3-fold increase in the number of insulin-producing cells and 2-fold decrease in blood glucose levels, correlated with the increased proliferative activity of pancreatic beta-cells in the diabetic phthalhydrazide-treated animals. Interestingly, the number of CD68+ cells/macrophages in the pancreatic islets, which was relatively high in the alloxan group (63,9+- 16.4/mm2), markedly decreased after the phthalhydrazide treatment (23,6+-7,2/mm2). Taking together with the previous data on the phthalhydrazide-related macrophage silencing, restriction of macrophage quantity in the alloxan-affected pancreatic islets can be possibly one of important events leading to the partial recovery from the beta-cell disruption.","type+1+diabetes"],["Mechanisms of Antimicrobial Action of Cinnamon and Oregano Oils, Cinnamaldehyde, Carvacrol, 2,5-Dihydroxybenzaldehyde, and 2-Hydroxy-5-Methoxybenzaldehyde against Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (Map).",["Nowotarska SW","Nowotarski K","Grant IR","Elliott CT","Friedman M","Situ C"],"Foods. 2017 Aug 24;6(9). pii: E72. doi: 10.3390/foods6090072.","The antimicrobial modes of action of six naturally occurring compounds, cinnamon oil, cinnamaldehyde, oregano oil, carvacrol, 2,5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde, and 2-hydroxy-5-methoxybenzaldehyde, previously found to inhibit the growth of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (Map) reported to infect food animals and humans and to be present in milk, cheese, and meat, were investigated.

However, it has been speculated that relapsing/remitting disease progression may occur in type 1 diabetes. METHODS: We report the case of an 18-year-old girl with Graves' disease, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) and multiple islet autoantibodies, presenting with relapsing/remitting hyperglycaemia. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were analysed for islet autoimmunity. RESULTS: There were two instances of hyperglycaemia relapse during CIDP flare-ups that required insulin therapy and remitted after i.v. immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy improving neurological symptoms. A diagnosis of type 1 diabetes was assigned on the basis of insulin need, HbA1c and islet autoantibodies. Insulin requirements disappeared following IVIG treatment and peaked during CIDP flare-ups. Pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine responses were noted against islet autoantigens. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We provide clinical evidence of relapsing/remitting type 1 diabetes associated with IVIG treatment and the regulation of islet autoimmunity. Despite sufficient residual beta cell mass, individuals can experience episodes of impaired glycaemia control. This disconnect between beta cell mass and function highlighted by our case may have implications for the use of beta cell function as the primary endpoint for immune intervention trials aiming to protect beta cell mass rather than function.

In this study, we develop a macroencapsulation device based on thin microwell membranes. The islets are seeded in separate microwells to avoid aggregation, whereas the membrane porosity is tailored to achieve sufficient transport of nutrients, glucose and insulin. The non-degradable, microwell membranes are composed of poly (ether sulfone)/polyvinylpyrrolidone and manufactured via phase separation micro molding.

Pancreatic islet transplantation could be an effective treatment option for type 1 diabetes once several issues are resolved, including donor shortage, prevention of islet necrosis and loss in pre- and post-transplantation, and optimization of immunosuppression. This study seeks to determine the cause of necrotic loss of isolated islets to improve transplant efficiency. METHODOLOGY: The oxygen tension inside isolated human islets of different sizes was simulated under varying oxygen environments using a computational in silico model. In vitro human islet viability was also assessed after culturing in different oxygen conditions. Correlation between simulation data and experimentally measured islet viability was examined. Using these in vitro viability data of human islets, the effect of islet diameter and oxygen tension of the culture environment on islet viability was also analyzed using a logistic regression model. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Computational simulation clearly revealed the oxygen gradient inside the islet structure. We found that oxygen tension in the islet core was greatly lower (hypoxic) than that on the islet surface due to the oxygen consumption by the cells. The hypoxic core was expanded in the larger islets or in lower oxygen cultures. These findings were consistent with results from in vitro islet viability assays that measured central necrosis in the islet core, indicating that hypoxia is one of the major causes of central necrosis. The logistic regression analysis revealed a negative effect of large islet and low oxygen culture on islet survival. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Hypoxic core conditions, induced by the oxygen gradient inside islets, contribute to the development of central necrosis of human isolated islets.

Here we demonstrate, in a rat model of early type-1 diabetes, that a physical therapy, the electroacupuncture, counteracts the diabetes-induced deleterious effects on hippocampal physiology by ameliorating hippocampal-related memory functions; recovering the impaired long-term potentiation at the dentate gyrus (DG-LTP) and the lowered expression of the vesicular glutamate transporter 1; normalizing the activity-dependent release of proNGF in diabetic rat hippocampus. Electroacupuncture exerted its therapeutic effects by regulating the expression and activity of M1- and M2-acetylcholine muscarinic receptors subtypes in the dentate gyrus of hippocampus. Our results suggest that a physical therapy based on repetitive sensory stimulation could promote hippocampal neural activity, neuronal metabolism and functions, and conceivably improve the diabetes-induced cognitive impairment.

However, the underlying mechanisms remain debated. We investigated MHC-II-mediated protection from type 1 diabetes using a previously reported NOD mouse line expressing an Ealpha transgene and, thereby, the Ealpha:Ebeta complex. Ealpha16/NOD females vertically protected their NOD offspring from diabetes and insulitis, an effect that was dependent on the intestinal microbiota; moreover, they developed autoimmunity when treated with certain antibiotics or raised in a germ-free environment. Genomic and proteomic analyses revealed NOD and Ealpha16/NOD mice to host mild but significant differences in the intestinal microbiotas during a critical early window of ontogeny, and transfer of cecal contents from the latter to the former suppressed insulitis. Thus, protection from autoimmunity afforded by particular MHC/HLA alleles can operate via intestinal microbes, highlighting potentially important societal implications of treating infants, or even just their pregnant mothers, with antibiotics.","type+1+diabetes"],["Response to Comment on Gagnum et al.

A Web-based patient portal, Sugarsquare, was developed to support parents, by providing online parent-professional communication, online peer support and online disease information. OBJECTIVE: The first aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of conducting a multicenter, randomized controlled trial in Dutch parents of a child with T1D. The second aim was to assess the feasibility of implementing Sugarsquare in clinical practice. METHODS: The parents of 105 children (N=105) with T1D below the age of 13 participated in a 6-month multicenter randomized controlled feasibility trial. They were randomly assigned to an experimental (n=54, usual care and Sugarsquare) or a control group (n=51, usual care). Attrition rates and user statistics were gathered to evaluate feasibility of the trial and implementation. To determine potential efficacy, the parenting stress index (PSI-SF) was assessed at baseline (T0) and after 6 months (T1). RESULTS: Of a potential population of parents of 445 children, 189 were willing to participate (enrollment refusal=57.5%, n=256), 142 filled in the baseline questionnaire (baseline attrition rate=25%, n=47), and 105 also filled in the questionnaire at T1 (post randomization attrition rate during follow-up=26%, n=32). As such, 24% of the potential population participated. Analysis in the experimental group (n=54) revealed a total of 32 (59%) unique users, divided into 12 (38%) frequent users, 9 (28%) incidental users, and 11 (34%) low-frequent users. Of the total of 44 professionals, 34 (77%) logged in, and 32 (73%) logged in repeatedly. Analysis of the user statistics in the experimental group further showed high practicability and integration in all users, moderate acceptability and demand in parents, and high acceptability and demand in health care professionals. Baseline parenting stress index scores were related to the parents' frequency of logging on (rho=.282, P=.03) and page-views (rho=.304, P=.01). No significant differences in change in parenting stress between experimental and control group were found (F3,101=.49, P=.49). CONCLUSIONS: The trial can be considered feasible, considering the average enrollment refusal rate, baseline attrition rate and postrandomization attrition rate, compared to other eHealth studies, although lower than hypothesized. Implementing Sugarsquare in clinical practice was partly feasible, given moderate demand and acceptability in parent users and lack of potential efficacy. Parents who reported higher levels of parenting stress used Sugarsquare more often than other parents, although Sugarsquare did not reduce parenting stress. These results indicate that Web-based interventions are a suitable way of providing parents of children with T1D with additional support. Future studies should determine how Sugarsquare could reduce parenting stress, for instance by adding targeted interventions. Factors potentially contributing to successful implementation are suggested.

In NOD mice, SFB colonization interferes with the development of type 1 diabetes (T1D), a T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease, suggesting that SFB may influence Th17 cells to inhibit Th1 populations associated with the anti-beta-cell immune response. This effect is a serious concern for investigators who use NOD mice for diabetes research because the expected incidence of disease decreases markedly when they are colonized by SFB. A room housing mice for T1D studies at The Jackson Laboratory was determined by fecal PCR testing to have widespread SFB colonization of multiple NOD strains after a steady decline in the incidence of T1D was noted. Rederivation of all NOD-related mouse strains was not feasible; therefore an alternative treatment using antibiotics to eliminate SFB from colonized mice was undertaken. After antibiotic treatment, soiled bedding from NOD mouse strains housed in SFB-free high-health-status production barrier rooms was used to reintroduce the gastrointestinal microbiota. Over the past 16 mo since treating the mice and disinfecting the mouse room, regular PCR testing has shown that no additional SFB colonization of mice has occurred, and the expected incidence of T1D has been reestablished in the offspring of treated mice.","type+1+diabetes"],["The Genetic Architecture of Type 1 Diabetes.",["Jerram ST","Leslie RD"],"Genes (Basel). 2017 Aug 22;8(8). pii: E209. doi: 10.3390/genes8080209.","Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is classically characterised by the clinical need for insulin, the presence of disease-associated serum autoantibodies, and an onset in childhood.

In this review, we focus on the nature of this interaction, and how our understanding of that gene-environment interaction has changed our understanding of the nature of the disease. We discuss the early onset of the disease, the development of distinct immunogenotypes, and the declining heritability with increasing age at diagnosis. Whilst Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA) have a major role in causing T1D, we note that some of these HLA genes have a protective role, especially in children, whilst other non-HLA genes are also important. In adult-onset T1D, the disease is often not insulin-dependent at diagnosis, and has a dissimilar immunogenotype with reduced genetic predisposition. Finally, we discuss the putative nature of the non-genetic factors and how they might interact with genetic susceptibility, including preliminary studies of the epigenome associated with T1D.","type+1+diabetes"],["Venous, Arterialized-Venous, or Capillary Glucose Reference Measurements for the Accuracy Assessment of a Continuous Glucose Monitoring System.",["Kropff J","van Steen SC","deGraaff P","Chan MW","van Amstel RBE","DeVries JH"],"Diabetes Technol Ther. 2017 Aug 22. doi: 10.1089/dia.2017.0189.","BACKGROUND: Different reference methods are used for the accuracy assessment of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems.

METHODS: We evaluated 21 individuals with type 1 diabetes using a capillary calibrated CGM system. Venous or arterialized-venous reference glucose samples were taken every 15 min at two separate visits and assessed per YSI 2300 STAT Plus. Arterialization was achieved by heated-hand technique. Capillary samples were collected hourly during the venous reference visit. The investigation sequence (venous or arterialized-venous) was randomized. Effectiveness of arterialization was measured by comparing free venous oxygen pressure (PO2) of both visit days. Primary endpoint was the median absolute relative difference (ARD). RESULTS: Median ARD using arterialized-venous reference samples was not different from venous samples (point estimated difference 0.52%, P = 0.181). When comparing the three reference methods, median ARD was also not different over the full glycemic range (venous 9.0% [n = 681], arterialized-venous 8.3% [n = 684], and capillary 8.1% [n = 205], P = 0.216), nor over the separate glucose ranges. Arterialization was successful (PO2 venous 5.4 kPa vs. arterialized-venous 8.9 kPa, P < 0.001). Arterialized-venous glucose was significantly higher than venous glucose and numerically higher than capillary glucose (arterialized-venous 142 mg/dL vs. venous 129 mg/dL [P < 0.001] and vs. capillary 134 mg/dL [P = 0.231]). Inconvenience related to arterialization included transient mild edema and redness of the hand in 4 out of 21 (19%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: The use of venous, arterialized-venous, or capillary reference measurements did not significantly impact CGM accuracy.

Methods: A cohort of 105 individuals with type 1 diabetes (20% DPN+ve) with predominantly mild or no retinopathy and no previous retinal photocoagulation underwent spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) at baseline, 2 years, and 4 years. SD-OCT scans were acquired at 3.45-mm diameter around the optic nerve head and the overall RNFL and RNFL in the nasal, superior, temporal, and inferior quadrants were quantified. By including serial quantified RNFL parameters, linear mixed models were applied to assess the change in RNFL thickness over time and to explore the associations with other clinical variables. Results: There was a significant decline in the overall RNFL thickness (-0.7 mum/y, P = 0.02) and RNFL in the superior quadrant (-1.9 mum/y, P < 0.01) in the DPN+ve group compared with DPN-ve group.

Aims: we wanted to determine and ilustrate the relationship between type 1 diabetes and autoimmune thyroiditis and also the factors than can influence it, like gender, age, diabetes duration. Glycemic control was also evaluated for all the patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: There were studied 256 patients, children and adolescents with T1DM (male/ female: 145/115; 55%/45%). Anti-TPO antibodies were detected using the electrohemiluminescence method and glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was measured through a imunoturbidimetric method. The patients were clinically examined, including thyroid gland palpation, blood pressure measurement and assessment of their pubertal status and growth. RESULTS: Age distribution at the time of T1DM diagnosis: most of them, 26% were diagnosed between 6 and 9 years, 23% between 1-3 years, 21% between 3-6 years, 19% between 9-12 years, 9% between 12-15 years, and very few of them (2%) were diagnosed between 15 and 18 years. Among these patients, 47/256 (18.3 %) were positive for thyroid antibodies (anti - TPO). In 2 of 47 patients tests for anti TPO antibodies were positive at the time of T1DM diagnosis. Tests for anti - TPO antibodies became positive with an average of 5.09+/-3.84 ( range 0-13) years after the diagnosis of T1DM. At the time that anti - thyroid antibodies were first seen to be positive all patients were euthyroid with a mean age of 11.3 years (range 4 -16) and a mean diabetes duration of 5.21+/-3.57 (range 0-9 years). After 5+/-3.3 years (range 0- 9 years) a progression towards subclinical hypothyroidism due to Hashimoto thyroiditis was observed in 41 from 47 patients (87.2%), while no patient developed clinical hypoythyroidism. It was observed an 9.2 % +/-1.5% mean value of HbA1c in patients with thyroiditis comparative with 7.9 % +/- 0.7 % mean HbA1c value in those without thyroiditis.

This study examined the risk of neuropathy in patients with T1D compared with patients with both T1D and CD. METHODS: In a nationwide population-based cohort, T1D was defined as having a diagnosis of diabetes between 1964 and 2009 recorded in the Swedish National Patient Register in individuals </=30 years of age. CD was defined as having villous atrophy (Marsh histopathology stage III) on small intestinal biopsy. CD cases were identified through biopsies examined between 1969 and 2008 at any of Sweden's 28 pathology departments. Nine hundred fifty-eight patients had both T1D and CD and were matched for sex, age, and calendar period with 4590 controls who only had T1D. Through Cox regression analysis, with CD as the time-dependent covariate, we estimated the risk of neuropathy in T1D patients with CD. RESULTS: Fifty-four individuals with T1D and CD had later neuropathy (expected: n = 42). This corresponded to an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.27 (95% confidence interval = 0.95-1.71) compared with those who had T1D alone. The hazard ratio was statistically significant in the first 5 years with CD (1.67; 95% confidence interval = 1.13-2.47) but decreased to neutrality thereafter. Risk estimates were similar in men and women, and did not differ by age at CD onset.

Pro-inflammatory including TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma and IL-1beta are released in the islet during the autoimmune assault and signal in beta-cells through phosphorylation cascades, resulting in pro-apoptotic gene expression and eventually beta-cell death. Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) are a family of enzymes that regulate phosphorylative signalling and are associated with the development of T1D. Here, we observed expression of PTPN6 and PTPN1 in human islets and islets from non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. To clarify the role of these PTPs in beta-cells/islets, we took advantage of CRISPR/Cas9 technology and pharmacological approaches to inactivate both proteins. We identify PTPN6 as a negative regulator of TNF-alpha-induced beta-cell death, through JNK-dependent BCL-2 protein degradation. In contrast, PTPN1 acts as a positive regulator of IFN-gamma-induced STAT1-dependent gene expression, which enhanced autoimmune destruction of beta-cells. Importantly, PTPN1 inactivation by pharmacological modulation protects beta-cells and primary mouse islets from cytokine-mediated cell death. Thus, our data point to a non-redundant effect of PTP regulation of cytokine signalling in beta-cells in autoimmune diabetes.","type+1+diabetes"],["Unravelling the stromal-nerve interactions in the human diabetic cornea.",["Priyadarsini S","Rowsey TG","Ma JX","Karamichos D"],"Exp Eye Res. 2017 Nov;164:22-30. doi: 10.1016/j.exer.2017.08.003.

METHODS: We retrospectively included 71 patients (mean age, 65.2 years [range, 41-84 years]; men, 91.5%) treated for abdominal aortic native or secondary graft infection (65 prosthetic graft infections; 16 of them had secondary aortoenteric fistula, 2 venous graft infections, and 4 mycotic aneurysms) by in situ reconstruction with CAA in the university hospitals of Clermont-Ferrand and Saint-Etienne from 2000 to 2016. The cryopreservation protocol was identical in both centers (-140 degrees C). Early (<30 days) and late (>30 days) mortality and morbidity, reinfection, and CAA patency were assessed. Computed tomography was performed in all survivors. Survival was analyzed with the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate analyses were performed with the log-rank test and multivariate analysis with the Cox regression model. RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 45 months (0-196 months). Early postoperative mortality rate was 16.9% (11/71). Early postoperative CAA-related mortality rate was 2.8% (2/71); both patients died of proximal anastomotic rupture on postoperative days 4 and 15. Early CAA-related reintervention rate was 5.6% (4/71); all had an anastomotic rupture, and two were lethal. Early postoperative reintervention rate was 15.5% (11/71). Intraoperative bacteriologic samples were positive in 56.3%, and 31% had a sole microorganism. Escherichia coli was more frequently identified in the secondary aortoenteric fistula and Staphylococcus epidermidis in the infected prosthesis. Late CAA-related mortality rate was 2.8%: septic shock at 2 months in one patient and proximal anastomosis rupture at 1 year in one patient. Survival at 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years was 75%, 64%, and 54%, respectively. Multivariate analysis identified type 1 diabetes (hazard ratio, 2.49; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-5.88; P = .04) and American Society of Anesthesiologists class 4 (hazard ratio, 2.65; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-6.53; P = .035) as predictors of mortality after in situ CAA reconstruction. Reinfection rate was 4% (3/71). Late CAA-related reintervention rate was 12.7% (9/71): proximal anastomotic rupture in one, CAA branch stenosis/thrombosis in five, ureteral-CAA branch fistula in one, and distal anastomosis false aneurysm in two. Primary patency at 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years was 100%, 93%, and 93%, respectively. Assisted primary patency at 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years was 100%, 96%, and 96%, respectively. No aneurysm or dilation was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis of native or secondary aortic graft infections is poor. Aortic in situ reconstruction with CAA offers acceptable early and late results. Patients with type 1 diabetes and American Society of Anesthesiologists class 4 are at higher risk of mortality.","type+1+diabetes"],["Subtyping of Type 1 Diabetes as Classified by Anti-GAD Antibody, IgE Levels, and Tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) Promoter Variant in the Japanese.",["Mine K","Hirakawa K","Kondo S","Minami M","Okada A","Tsutsu N","Yokogawa Y","Hibio Y","Kojima F","Fujimoto S","Kurisaki H","Anzai K","Yoshikai Y","Nagafuchi S"],"EBioMedicine. 2017 Sep;23:46-51. doi: 10.1016/j.ebiom.2017.08.012.

Recently, we reported that TYK2 promoter variant serves as a putative virus-induced diabetes susceptibility gene associated with deteriorated interferon-dependent antiviral response. TYK2 is also related to HIES, that is, Th2 cell-dependent. Therefore, TYK2 promoter variant may be also associated with the pathogenesis of T1D, modulating Th1/Th2 balance. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We assessed the association between anti- GAD Ab, IgE levels, and TYK2 promoter variant among 313 T1D patients, 184 T2D patients, and 264 YH controls in the Japanese. RESULTS: T1D patients had elevated IgE (median, 56.7U/ml; p<0.0001) compared with T2D patients (22.5U/ml) and controls (43.3U/ml). Contrary to our expectations, there was no correlation between TYK2 promoter variant and IgE levels. We found that T1D could be subtyped as four groups based on anti-GAD Ab and IgE profile: Subtype 1, anti-GAD Ab positive and non-elevated IgE (47.0%); Subtype 2, anti-GAD Ab negative and non-elevated IgE (35.1%); Subtype 3, anti-GAD Ab positive and elevated IgE (10.9%); and Subtype 4, anti-GAD Ab negative and elevated IgE (7.0%). In Subtype 2, a significantly higher incidence was observed in T1D cases carrying the TYK2 promoter variant (OR, 2.60; 95%CI, 1.03-6.97; p=0.032), and also showing a flu-like syndrome at diabetes onset (OR, 2.34; 95%CI, 1.27-4.35; p=0.003).

Epub 2017 Jul 19.","Chromosome 17q21 contains a cluster of genes including ORMDL3 and GSDMB, which have been highly linked to asthma in genome-wide association studies. ORMDL3 is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and regulates downstream pathways including sphingolipids, metalloproteases, remodeling genes, and chemokines. ORMDL3 inhibits serine palmitoyl-CoA transferase, the rate-limiting enzyme for sphingolipid biosynthesis. In addition, ORMDL3 activates the ATF6alpha branch of the unfolded protein response which regulates SERCA2b and IL-6, pathways of potential importance to asthma. The SNP-linking chromosome 17q21 to asthma is associated with increased ORMDL3 and GSDMB expression. Mice expressing either increased levels of human ORMDL3, or human GSDMB, have an asthma phenotype characterized by increased airway responsiveness and increased airway remodeling (increased smooth muscle and fibrosis) in the absence of airway inflammation. GSDMB regulates expression of 5-LO and TGF-beta1 which are known pathways involved in the pathogenesis of asthma. GSDMB is one of four members of the GSDM family (GSDMA, GSDMB, GSDMC, and GSDMD). GSDMD (located on chromosome 8q24 and not linked to asthma) has emerged as a key mediator of pyroptosis. GSDMD is a key component of the NLPR3 inflammasome and is required for its activation. GSDMD undergoes proteolytic cleavage by caspase-1 to release its N-terminal fragment, which in turn mediates pyroptosis and IL-1beta secretion. Chromosome 17q21 has not only been linked to asthma but also to type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and primary biliary cirrhosis suggesting that future insights into the biology of genes located in this region will increase our understanding of these diseases.","type+1+diabetes"],["Eating Disorders and Disordered Eating Symptoms in Adolescents with Type 1 Diabetes.",["Toni G","Berioli MG","Cerquiglini L","Ceccarini G","Grohmann U","Principi N","Esposito S"],"Nutrients. 2017 Aug 19;9(8). pii: E906. doi: 10.3390/nu9080906.","Eating problems in adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) can be divided into two groups.

The second is the group of disordered eating symptoms (DES), which include behaviors such as dieting for weight loss, binge eating, self-induced vomiting, excessive exercise, and laxative or diuretic use; these behaviors cannot be categorized as complete diseases, and, although apparently mild, they must be closely evaluated because they can evolve into true EDs. In this review, present knowledge about the clinical relevance of EDs and DES and the possible preventive and therapeutic measures used to reduce their impact on the course of T1D will be discussed. As adolescents with diabetes are at higher risk of eating disturbances and consequently for higher rates of disease complications, care providers should pay attention to clinical warning signs that raise suspicion of disturbed eating to refer these patients early to an expert in nutrition and mental health disorders.

With subsequent improvements in the treatment of diabetes, concurrent with changes in the provision of emergency medical care, a decline in the frequency of severe hypoglycemia could be anticipated. The present population-based data-linkage cohort study aimed to ascertain whether a temporal change has occurred in the incidence rates of hypoglycemia requiring emergency medical services in people with types 1 and 2 diabetes. METHODS: The study population comprised all people with diabetes in Tayside, Scotland over the period 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2012. Patients' data from different healthcare sources were linked anonymously to measure the incidence rates of hypoglycemia requiring emergency medical services that include treatment by ambulance staff and in hospital emergency departments, and necessitated hospital admission. These were compared with data recorded in 1997-1998 in the same region.

Type 1 diabetes mellitus (type 1 DM) is due to autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells because of enhanced production of IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and other pro-inflammatory cytokines released by immunocytes infiltrating the pancreas in response to unknown exogenous and endogenous toxin(s). On the other hand, type 2 DM is due to increased peripheral insulin resistance secondary to enhanced production of IL-6 and TNF-alpha in response to high-fat and/or calorie-rich diet (rich in saturated and trans fats). Type 2 DM is also associated with significant alterations in the production and action of hypothalamic neurotransmitters, eNO, BDNF, free radicals, gut hormones, and vagus nerve activity. Thus, type 1 DM is because of excess production of pro-inflammatory cytokines close to beta cells, whereas type 2 DM is due to excess of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the systemic circulation. Hence, methods designed to suppress excess production of pro-inflammatory cytokines may form a new approach to prevent both type 1 and type 2 DM. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and similar surgeries ameliorate type 2 DM, partly by restoring to normal: gut hormones, hypothalamic neurotransmitters, eNO, vagal activity, gut microbiota, bioactive lipids, BDNF production in the gut and hypothalamus, concentrations of cytokines and free radicals that results in resetting glucose-stimulated insulin production by pancreatic beta cells. Our recent studies suggested that bioactive lipids, such as arachidonic acid, eicosapentaneoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid (which are unsaturated fatty acids) and their anti-inflammatory metabolites: lipoxin A4, resolvins, protectins, and maresins, may have antidiabetic actions. These bioactive lipids have anti-inflammatory actions, enhance eNO, BDNF production, restore hypothalamic dysfunction, enhance vagal tone, modulate production and action of ghrelin, leptin and adiponectin, and influence gut microbiota that may explain their antidiabetic action. These pieces of evidence suggest that methods designed to selectively deliver bioactive lipids to pancreatic beta cells, gut, liver, and muscle may prevent type 1 and type 2 DM.","type+1+diabetes"],["Therapeutic molecules against type 2 diabetes: What we have and what are we expecting?",["Kumar A","Bharti SK","Kumar A"],"Pharmacol Rep. 2017 Apr 9;69(5):959-970. doi: 10.1016/j.pharep.2017.04.003.","World Health Organization (WHO) has identified diabetes as one of the fastest growing non-communicable diseases with 422 million patients around the world in 2014.

Numerous T1D consortia have been established to collect whole blood for gene expression analysis from individuals with or at risk to develop T1D. However, with no universally accepted protocol for their collection, differences in sample processing may lead to variances in the results. Here, we examined whether the choice of blood collection tube and RNA extraction kit leads to differences in the expression of genes that are changed during the progression of T1D, and if these differences could be minimized by measuring gene expression directly from the lysate of whole blood. RESULTS: Microarray analysis showed that the expression of 901 genes is highly influenced by sample processing using the PAXgene versus the Tempus system. These included a significant number of lymphocyte-specific genes and genes whose expression has been reported to differ in the peripheral blood of at-risk and T1D patients compared to controls. We showed that artificial changes in gene expression occur when control and T1D samples were processed differently. The sample processing-dependent differences in gene expression were largely due to loss of transcripts during the RNA extraction step using the PAXgene system. The majority of differences were not observed when gene expression was measured in whole blood lysates prepared from blood collected in PAXgene and Tempus tubes. CONCLUSION: We showed that the gene expression profile of samples processed using the Tempus system is more accurate than that of samples processed using the PAXgene system. Variation in sample processing can result in misleading changes in gene expression.

There are a number of varied immune mechanisms for sustaining self-tolerance in opposition to the autoimmune disorders. A recessive tolerance is accomplished by thymic gland via a negative assortment of different clones, while a dominant tolerance is accomplished by the regulatory T cells (Treg) in the periphery. Treg (CD4+ CD25+FOXP3+) are subsets of T cells which have an essential role in maintaining tolerance. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate peripheral Treg (CD4+; CD25+; FOXP3+) in children cohort with T1DM. METHODS: This study included 64 children diagnosed with T1DM and 35 age- and sex-matched healthy children as controls. All children were clinically evaluated and subjected to assessment of complete blood count (CBC), glycated hemoglobin, surface and cytoplasmic detection of Treg by flow cytometry. RESULTS: This study showed that the frequency of Treg (CD4+; CD25+; FOXP3+) was significantly lower in diabetic children than with normal controls (P<0.001).

CONCLUSION: Diminished Treg in T1DM proved that auto-reactivation of T-cell as a result of the breakdown of immune tolerance takes part in the elaboration of autoimmune disorders as T1DM. Treg may be used in immunotherapy, thus preventing T1DM development due to its pivotal role in immune tolerance.","type+1+diabetes"],["Insulin delivery and nocturnal glucose control in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes.",["Tauschmann M","Hovorka R"],"Expert Opin Drug Deliv. 2017 Aug 18:1-11. doi: 10.1080/17425247.2017.1360866.","INTRODUCTION: Nocturnal glucose control remains challenging in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes due to highly variable overnight insulin requirements.

PAS cluster with several non-endocrine autoimmune diseases. In most endocrinopathies of PAS, the autoimmune process causes an irreversible loss of function, while chronic autoimmune aggressions can simultaneously modify physiological processes in the affected tissue and lead to altered organ function. The rare juvenile PAS type I is inherited in a monogenetic manner, whereas several susceptibility gene polymorphisms have been reported for the more prevalent adult types. Relevant for a timely diagnosis at an early stage is the screening for polyglandular autoimmunity in patients with monoglandular autoimmune disease and/or first degree relatives of patients with PAS. The most prevalent adult PAS type is the combination of type 1 diabetes with autoimmune thyroid disease. CONCLUSIONS: Early detection of specific autoantibodies and latent organ-specific dysfunction is advocated to alert physicians to take appropriate action in order to prevent full-blown PAS disease.","type+1+diabetes"],["Detection of Islet Cell Immune Reactivity with Low Glycemic Index Foods: Is This a Concern for Type 1 Diabetes?",["Kharrazian D","Herbert M","Vojdani A"],"J Diabetes Res. 2017;2017:4124967. doi: 10.1155/2017/4124967.

Physical activity has various beneficial effects on type 1 diabetes. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to assess a relation between physical activity and olfactory function in patients with type 1 diabetes. PATIENTS AND METHODS We enrolled 120 patients with type 1 diabetes referred to an outpatient diabetes clinic. Patients with diabetes duration of less than 5 years, age above 65 years, concomitant diabetic ketoacidosis, and those using drugs affecting nasal mucosa were excluded. The final study sample included 90 patients. A control group comprised 22 healthy participants. Olfactory function was assessed using 12 odoremitting apens called Sniffin' Sticks. Physical activity was measured using the short version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQSF). RESULTS There was a significant difference in the occurrence of hyposmia between diabetic patients and healthy controls (70.0% vs 45.5%, respectively; P = 0.03). There were no significant differences in IPAQSF results between the groups. Moreover, IPAQSF results correlated positively with olfactory test scores (r = 0.25; P = 0.02) and negatively with age. Additionally, patients with retinopathy and autonomic neuropathy obtained lower IPAQSF scores than patients without those complications. A stepwise multivariable linear regression analysis indicated IPAQ scores, body mass index, and peripheral neuropathy as predictors of the olfactory test score (R = 0.2).

METHODS: In this open-label, randomized, 2-period crossover study, 14 patients with type 1 diabetes received once-daily, individualized, stable BIL or GL doses for 3 weeks. Palmitate flux was assessed using [9,10-3 H]palmitate infusion. VLDL-TG secretion, clearance and oxidation rate were assessed using primed-constant infusion of ex vivo labelled [1-14 C]VLDL-TG, while VLDL-TG storage rate was assessed using [9,10-3 H]VLDL-TG bolus injection. RESULTS: The VLDL-TG concentration and secretion rate, and palmitate flux were statistically significantly higher during BIL than during GL treatment (58%, 51% and 35%, respectively). The ratios of least squares (LS) geometric means for VLDL-TG clearance and oxidation were 0.92 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72, 1.17) and 1.31 (95% CI 0.91, 1.90), respectively. The difference in LS means for VLDL-TG storage rate was -0.36 (95% CI -0.83, 0.12). CONCLUSIONS: BIL-treated patients had higher effective lipolysis, VLDL-TG secretion and VLDL-TG concentration compared with GL-treated patients, explaining the increased plasma TG concentrations reported previously.

It is a clinical syndrome characterized by a markedly rapid and almost complete destruction of pancreatic beta cells. Metabolic derangement is more severe in this subtype than in autoimmune type 1 diabetes. The incidence of fT1D is associated with HLA DRB1*04:05DQB1*04:01; both innate and acquired immune disorders might contribute to the development of fT1D. The presence of specific innate immune responses to enterovirus infection connected with enhanced adaptive immune pathways responsible for aggressive beta cell toxicity in fT1D. The process of beta cell destruction is extremely rapid in fT1D, and the insulin secretary capacity rarely recovers after the onset. The serum glycated albumin to glycated haemoglobin ratio is significantly higher in fT1D; a cut-off value of 3.2 for serum glycated albumin to glycated haemoglobin ratio yielded 97% sensitivity and 98% specificity for differentiating fT1D from type 2 diabetes.

Vitamin D intake was assessed by age-specific 3 day food records. Parents completed a validated version of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood questionnaire at 5 years. RESULTS: At 3 months, supplements were the main source of vitamin D intake; intake from foods increased from 3 months on, mainly from fortified milk products. Vitamin D intake at each specific age was associated with an increased risk of any asthma, atopic, and non-atopic asthma, but only intake at 1 and 2 years was statistically significantly associated with asthma. Longitudinal vitamin D intake was associated with an increased risk of asthma (OR 1.24; 95%CI 1.00-1.53).

By implication, such epigenetic changes are non-genetically determined, although they can be affected by inherited genetic variation. Extensive evidence indicates that autoimmune diseases including type 1 diabetes are determined by the interaction of genetic and non-genetic factors. Much is known of the genetic causes of these diseases, but the non-genetic effects are less clear-cut. Further, it remains unclear how they interact to cause the destructive autoimmune process. This review identifies the key issues in the genetic/non-genetic interaction, examining the most recent evidence of the role of non-genetic effects in the disease process, including the impact of epigenetic effects on key pathways. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent research indicates that these pathways likely involve immune effector cells both of the innate and adaptive immune response. Specifically, there is evidence of cell type-specific enrichment in altered DNA methylation, changes which were temporally stable and enriched at gene regulatory elements. Epigenomics remains in its infancy, and we anticipate further studies will define how the interaction of genetic and non-genetic effects induces tissue-specific destruction and enhances our ability to predict, and possibly even modify that process.","type+1+diabetes"],["Capturing the systemic immune signature of a norovirus infection: an n-of-1 case study within a clinical trial.",["J Cutler A","Oliveira J","C Ferreira R","Challis B","M Walker N","Caddy S","Lu J","E Stevens H","J Smyth D","L Pekalski M","Kennet J","M D Hunter K","Goodfellow I","S Wicker L","A Todd J","Waldron-Lynch F"],"Wellcome Open Res. 2017 Jul 18;2:28. doi: 10.12688/wellcomeopenres.11300.2. eCollection 2017.","BACKGROUND: The infection of a participant with norovirus during the adaptive study of interleukin-2 dose on regulatory T cells in type 1 diabetes (DILT1D) allowed a detailed insight into the cellular and cytokine immune responses to this prevalent gastrointestinal pathogen. METHODS: Serial blood, serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples were collected pre-, and post-development of the infection. To differentiate between the immune response to norovirus and to control for the administration of a single dose of aldesleukin (recombinant interleukin-2, rIL-2) alone, samples from five non-infected participants administered similar doses were analysed in parallel. RESULTS: Norovirus infection was self-limited and resolved within 24 hours, with the subsequent development of anti-norovirus antibodies. Serum pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine levels, including IL-10, peaked during the symptomatic period of infection, coincident with increased frequencies of monocytes and neutrophils. At the same time, the frequency of regulatory CD4 + T cell (Treg), effector T cell (Teff) CD4 + and CD8 + subsets were dynamically reduced, rebounding to baseline levels or above at the next sampling point 24 hours later. NK cells and NKT cells transiently increased CD69 expression and classical monocytes expressed increased levels of CD40, HLA-DR and SIGLEC-1, biomarkers of an interferon response. We also observed activation and mobilisation of Teffs, where increased frequencies of CD69 + and Ki-67 + effector memory Teffs were followed by the emergence of memory CD8 + Teff expressing the mucosal tissue homing markers CD103 and beta7 integrin. Treg responses were coincident with the innate cell, Teff and cytokine response. Key Treg molecules FOXP3, CTLA-4, and CD25 were upregulated following infection, alongside an increase in frequency of Tregs with the capacity to home to tissues.

We developed a robust method for large-scale expansion of human GBCs ex vivo. GBCs were reprogrammed into insulin-producing pancreatic beta-like cells by a combined adenoviral-mediated expression of hallmark pancreatic endocrine transcription factors PDX1, MAFA, NEUROG3, and PAX6 and differentiation culture in vitro. The reprogrammed GBCs (rGBCs) strongly induced the production of insulin and pancreatic endocrine genes and these responded to glucose stimulation in vitro. rGBCs also expressed an islet-specific surface marker, which was used to enrich for the most highly reprogrammed cells. More importantly, global mRNA and microRNA expression profiles and protein immunostaining indicated that rGBCs adopted an overall beta-like state and these rGBCs engrafted in immunodeficient mice. Furthermore, comparative global expression analyses identified putative regulators of human biliary to beta cell fate conversion. In summary, we have developed, for the first time, a reliable and robust genetic reprogramming and culture expansion of primary human GBCs-derived from multiple unrelated donors-into pancreatic beta-like cells ex vivo, thus showing that human gallbladder is a potentially rich source of reprogrammable cells for autologous cell therapy in diabetes.","type+1+diabetes"],["Ankle-brachial index and diabetic neuropathy: study of 225 patients.",["Chevtchouk L","Silva MHSD","Nascimento OJMD"],"Arq Neuropsiquiatr. 2017 Aug;75(8):533-538. doi: 10.1590/0004-282X20170084.","Objective: To evaluate neuropathic pain and peripheral vascular disease in diabetics and compare this with the length of time since diagnosis in type 1, and type 2 diabetes.

Methods: Diabetic mice were treated with subconjunctival injections of BM-MSCs or recombinant tumor necrosis factor-alpha-stimulated gene/protein-6 (TSG-6). The corneal epithelial wound healing rate was examined by fluorescein staining. The mRNA and protein expression levels of TSG-6 were measured by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot. The infiltrations of leukocytes and macrophages were analyzed by flow cytometry and immunofluoresence staining. The effect of TSG-6 was further evaluated in cultured limbal epithelial stem/progenitor cells, macrophages, and diabetic mice by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown. Results: Local MSC transplantation significantly promoted diabetic corneal epithelial wound healing, accompanied by elevated corneal TSG-6 expression, increased corneal epithelial cell proliferation, and attenuated inflammatory response. Moreover, in cultured human limbal epithelial stem/progenitor cells, TSG-6 enhanced the colony-forming efficiency, stimulated mitogenic proliferation, and upregulated the expression level of DeltaNp63. Furthermore, in diabetic mouse cornea and in vitro macrophage culture, TSG-6 alleviated leukocyte infiltration and promoted the polarization of recruited macrophages to anti-inflammatory M2 phenotypes with increased phagocytotic capacity. In addition, the promotion of epithelial stem/progenitor cell activation and macrophage polarization by MSC transplantation was largely abrogated by shRNA knockdown of TSG-6. Conclusions: This study provided the first evidence of TSG-6 secreted by MSCs promoting corneal epithelial wound healing in diabetic mice through activating corneal epithelial stem/progenitor cells and accelerating M2 macrophage polarization.","type+1+diabetes"],["Type 1 Diabetes and Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: When Should We Be Concerned?

A higher prevalence of associated comorbidities is expected, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This paper reports a cross-sectional multicenter study on a population with T1D (n = 1662), which aimed to evaluate the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MS), a known risk factor for NAFLD, and to investigate predisposing factors associated with MS, as well as factors associated with elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT), as it correlates to liver fat content. Patients were from 14 public clinics of 10 cities from all geographical regions of Brazil. A high prevalence of MS was found, especially among adults (32.3%), and this was related to age, female gender, acid uric levels, and the presence of acanthosis nigricans. ALT above the normal range was associated with triglyceride levels (especially above 129.5 mg/dL), serum uric acid, age, male gender, HbA1c, and non-Caucasian ethnicity. Patients with T1D, metabolic syndrome, and the aforementioned factors may be at a higher risk of NAFLD and should be referred to ultrasound for NAFLD evaluation.

There is little evidence about the impact of parental caregiving in developing countries, where fixed dose human insulin (conventional) therapy and limited self-monitoring of blood glucose are common. This article investigates whether performance of key T1D management tasks by children or their caregivers impacts hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). METHODS: We surveyed the caregivers of 179 children with T1D routinely treated in a specialized diabetes clinic in Maharashtra, India to determine who performs key diabetes care tasks: child or parent. We used linear regression to estimate the relationship between parental caregiving and HbA1c, and how this association varies by child age and time since diagnosis. RESULTS: Caregivers of older children were less involved in care tasks, though caregivers of 11- to 18-year olds performed more care for children diagnosed for a longer duration. Parental involvement in key insulin delivery tasks was associated with lower HbA1c levels for all children. These reductions were greatest among children 11 to 14 years old and diagnosed for less than 2 years: mean HbA1c levels were 8.5% (69 mmol/mol) if the caregiver, and 14.4% (134 mmol/mol) if the child, performed the tasks (P < .05). CONCLUSION: Parents of children diagnosed with T1D early in life remain involved in care throughout the child's adolescence. Parents of children diagnosed in late childhood and early adolescence are significantly less involved in care, and this is associated with worse glycemic control. Clinics must know who performs care tasks and tailor diabetes education appropriately.","type+1+diabetes"],["HLA Class II Allele, Haplotype, and Genotype Associations with Type 1 Diabetes in Benin: A Pilot Study.",["Fagbemi KA","Medehouenou TCM","Azonbakin S","Adjagba M","Osseni R","Ahoueya J","Agbanlinsou A","Darboux R","Baba-Moussa L","Laleye A"],"J Diabetes Res. 2017;2017:6053764. doi: 10.1155/2017/6053764.

This study estimates the budget impact of treatment with CSII, as compared to multiple daily insulin injections, of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus who experience recurrent severe hypoglycemia episodes from the National Healthcare System perspective. METHODS: Budget impact was based on a retrospective, observational study evaluating the efficacy of CSII in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus conducted at Hospital Clinic i Universitari in Barcelona, where one of the main indications for switching to CSII were recurrent severe hypoglycemia episodes. The mean number of annual episodes was 1.33 in the two years prior to CSII start and 0.08 in the last two years of follow up (p=0.003). Costs of treatment and major hypoglycemic events over a four-year period were considered. Costs were taken from different Spanish data sources and expressed in euro of 2016. RESULTS: Treatment with CSII increased costs by euro9,509 per patient as compared to multiple daily insulin injections (euro11,902-euro2,393). Cost associated to severe hypoglycemic events decreased by euro19,330 per patient treated with CSIII (euro1,371-euro20,701).

METHODS: This study was conducted at Alexandria University Children's Hospital from April to October 2015. The study was conducted with 30 newly diagnosed T1DM patients (15 males and 15 females), aged 7-13 years (10.6+/-1.8 years) and 20 non-diabetic subjects served as age- and sex-matched controls. The patients were further sub-divided into two groups; group I included patients who first presented with classical symptoms of DM (polyuria, polydipsia, and polyphagia) without diabetes ketoacidosis (DKA) and group II included patients who first presented with DKA. The expression of the KLRC3 gene was measured in each group using the real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: KLRC3 gene expression was significantly downregulated in T1DM cases compared to healthy controls (p = 0.001). Expression was more downregulated in group I patients (p = 0.008). Moreover, there was higher mean value of glycated heamoglobin and lower C-peptide levels in group I than group II. Serum pancreatic amylase showed no significant difference between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: KLRC3 gene expression was downregulated in patients with T1DM compared to healthy controls. Downregulation of expression was greater in DKA patients compared to those who presented with classical symptoms. Expression of KLRC3 in T1DM might play a role in the pathogenesis of T1DM and could be a predictor of its severity.","type+1+diabetes"],["Mitigating Ischemic Injury of Stem Cell-Derived Insulin-Producing Cells after Transplant.",["Faleo G","Russ HA","Wisel S","Parent AV","Nguyen V","Nair GG","Freise JE","Villanueva KE","Szot GL","Hebrok M","Tang Q"],"Stem Cell Reports. 2017 Sep 12;9(3):807-819. doi: 10.1016/j.stemcr.2017.07.012.

It is unclear to what extent human SCIPC are susceptible to ischemia. In this study, we show that more than half of SCIPC die shortly after transplantation. Nutrient deprivation and hypoxia acted synergistically to kill SCIPC in vitro. Amino acid supplementation rescued SCIPC from nutrient deprivation, likely by providing cellular energy. Generating SCIPC under physiological oxygen tension of 5% conferred hypoxia resistance without affecting their differentiation or function.

Sensory neurons obtained from age-matched adult control or streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 1 diabetic rats were cultured with or without insulin before determining mitochondrial respiration and expression of mitochondrial respiratory chain and insulin signaling-linked proteins. For in vivo studies age-matched control rats and diabetic rats with or without trace insulin supplementation were maintained for 5months before DRG were analyzed for respiratory chain gene expression and cytochrome c oxidase activity. Insulin (10nM) significantly (P<0.05) increased phosphorylation of Akt and P70S6K by 4-fold and neurite outgrowth by 2-fold in DRG cultures derived from adult control rats. Insulin also augmented the levels of selective mitochondrial respiratory chain proteins and mitochondrial bioenergetics parameters in DRG cultures from control and diabetic rats, with spare respiratory capacity increased by up to 3-fold (P<0.05). Insulin-treated diabetic animals exhibited improved thermal sensitivity in the hind paw and had increased dermal nerve density compared to untreated diabetic rats, despite no effect on blood glucose levels. In DRG of diabetic rats there was suppressed expression of mitochondrial respiratory chain proteins and cytochrome c oxidase activity that was corrected by insulin therapy.

One possibility is that post-translational modification of self-antigens leads to peripheral recognition of neo-epitopes against which central and peripheral tolerance is inadequate. Accumulating evidence points to multiple mechanisms through which non-germline encoded sequences can give rise to these non-conventional epitopes which in turn engage the immune system as T cell targets. In particular, where these modifications alter the rules of epitope engagement with MHC molecules, such non-conventional epitopes offer a persuasive explanation for associations between specific HLA alleles and autoimmune diseases. In this review article, we discuss current understanding of mechanisms through which non-conventional epitopes may be generated, focusing on several recently described pathways that can transpose germline-encoded sequences. We contextualise these discoveries around type 1 diabetes, the prototypic organ-specific autoimmune disease in which specific HLA-DQ molecules confer high risk. Non-conventional epitopes have the potential to act as tolerance breakers or disease drivers in type 1 diabetes, prompting a timely re-evaluation of models of a etiopathogenesis.

Sixty-seven consecutive subjects who did not attain the desired HbA1c target (mean HbA1c, 8.3% [67 mmol/mol]) were compared with 30 cases in satisfactory metabolic control (HbA1c levels <7%-53 mmol/mol). RESULTS: In the overall population, SOC was negatively associated with BMI and average HbA1c, as was the association of self-esteem with HbA1c. Subjects attaining the desired metabolic target were characterized by higher SOC scores, higher Internal HLOC and prevalent Internal vs. Powerful-others HLOC. Compared to subjects in good metabolic control, subjects with unsatisfactory control had lower scores of SOC, Internal HLOC and Self-esteem, with no difference in Powerful others, or Chance HLOC.

However, adverse side effects have prevented its use in the clinic. In view of the promising effects of thyroid hormones, we investigated the effects of levothyroxine supplementation on glucose homeostasis. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: C57BL/6 mice were treated with levothyroxine from birth to 24 weeks of age, when mice were killed. The effects of levothyroxine supplementation on metabolic health were determined. C57BL/6 mice treated with levothyroxine for 2 weeks and then challenged with streptozotocin to monitor survival. Mechanistic experiments were conducted in the pancreas, liver and skeletal muscle. RIP-B7.1 mice were treated with levothyroxine for 2 weeks and were subsequently immunized to trigger experimental autoimmune diabetes (EAD). Metabolic tests were performed. Mice were killed and metabolic tissues were extracted for immunohistological analyses. KEY RESULTS: Long-term levothyroxine supplementation enhanced glucose clearance and reduced circulating glucose in C57BL/6 mice. Levothyroxine increased simultaneously the proliferation and apoptosis of pancreatic beta cells, promoting the maintenance of a highly insulin-expressing beta cell population. Levothyroxine increased circulating insulin levels, inducing sustained activation of IRS1-AKT signalling in insulin-target tissues. Levothyroxine-treated C57BL/6 mice challenged with streptozotocin exhibited extended survival. Levothyroxine blunted the onset of EAD in RIP-B7.1 mice by inducing beta cell proliferation and preservation of insulin-expressing cells.

Metabolomics profiling of samples collected at five different time-points identified 676 and 706 biochemicals in blood and feces, respectively. Several metabolites were expressed at significantly different levels in progressors at all time-points, and their proportion increased strongly following onset of hyperglycemia. At the last time-point, when all progressors were diabetic, a large percentage of metabolites had significantly different levels: 57.8% in blood and 27.8% in feces. Metabolic pathways most strongly affected included the carbohydrate, lipid, branched-chain amino acid, and oxidative ones. Several biochemicals showed considerable (>4x) change. Maltose, 3-hydroxybutyric acid, and kojibiose increased, while 1,5-anhydroglucitol decreased more than 10-fold. At the earliest time-point (6-week), differences between the metabolic signatures of progressors and nonprogressors were relatively modest. Nevertheless, several compounds had significantly different levels and show promise as possible early T1D biomarkers. They include fatty acid phosphocholine derivatives from the phosphatidylcholine subpathway (elevated in both blood and feces) as well as serotonin, ribose, and arabinose (increased) in blood plus 13-HODE, tocopherol (increased), diaminopimelate, valerate, hydroxymethylpyrimidine, and dulcitol (decreased) in feces. A combined metabolic signature based on these compounds might serve as an early predictor of T1D-progressors.","type+1+diabetes"],["Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency Unveiled by Diabetic Ketoacidosis: A Dual Dilemma.",["Mehta P","Srivastav V","Bhate P","Gupta V","Nadkar MY"],"J Assoc Physicians India. 2017 Aug;65(8):98-102.","An 18 year old male, known case of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus was admitted in view of diabetic ketoacidosis.

Pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes are at greater risk of perinatal morbidity and diabetic complications. The relationship between glycaemic control and health outcomes for both mothers and infants indicates the potential for preconception care for these women to be of benefit. This is an update of the original review, which was first published in 2010. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of preconception care in women with diabetes on health outcomes for mothers and their infants. SEARCH METHODS: We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register (31 January 2017) and reference lists of retrieved articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of preconception care for diabetic women. Cluster-RCTs and quasi-RCTs were eligible for inclusion but none were identified. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. We checked data for accuracy and assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: We included three trials involving 254 adolescent girls with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, with an overall unclear to high risk of bias. The three trials were conducted at diabetes clinics in the USA, and assessed the READY-Girls (Reproductive-health Education and Awareness of Diabetes in Youth for Girls) programme versus standard care.Considering primary outcomes, one trial reported no pregnancies in the trial period (12 months) (very low-quality evidence, with downgrading based on study limitations (risk of bias) and imprecision); in the other two trials, pregnancy was an exclusion criterion, or was not clearly reported on. None of the trials reported on the other primary maternal outcomes, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and caesarean section; or primary infant outcomes, large-for-gestational age, perinatal mortality, death or morbidity composite, or congenital malformations. Similarly, none of the trials reported on the secondary outcomes, for which we had planned to assess the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach (maternal: induction of labour; perineal trauma; gestational weight gain; long-term cardiovascular health; infant: adiposity; type 1 or 2 diabetes; neurosensory disability).The majority of secondary maternal and infant outcomes, and outcomes relating to the use and costs of health services were not reported by the three included trials. Regarding behaviour changes associated with the intervention, in one trial, participants in the preconception care group had a slightly higher score for the actual initiation of discussion regarding preconception care with healthcare providers at follow-up (nine months), compared with those in the standard care group (mean difference 0.40, 95% confidence interval -0.02 to 0.82 (on a scale of 0 to 4 points); participants = 87) (a summation of four dichotomous items; possible range 0 to 4, with 0 being no discussion). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There are insufficient RCT data available to assess the effects of preconception care for diabetic women on health outcomes for mothers and their infants.More high-quality evidence is needed to determine the effects of different protocols of preconception care for diabetic women. Future trials should be powered to evaluate effects on short- and long-term maternal and infant outcomes, and outcomes relating to the use and costs of health services. We have identified three ongoing studies that we will consider in the next review update.","type+1+diabetes"],["The Association of Falling Insulin Requirements With Maternal Biomarkers and Placental Dysfunction: A Prospective Study of Women With Preexisting Diabetes in Pregnancy.",["Padmanabhan S","Lee VW","Mclean M","Athayde N","Lanzarone V","Khoshnow Q","Peek MJ","Cheung NW"],"Diabetes Care. 2017 Oct;40(10):1323-1330. doi: 10.2337/dc17-0391.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A multicenter prospective cohort study of 158 women (41 with type 1 diabetes and 117 with type 2 diabetes) was conducted. Women with FIR of >/=15% from the peak total daily dose after 20 weeks' gestation were considered case subjects (n = 32). The primary outcome was a composite of clinical markers of placental dysfunction (preeclampsia, small for gestational age [</=5th centile], stillbirth, premature delivery [<30 weeks], and placental abruption). Maternal circulating angiogenic markers (placental growth factor [PlGF] and soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 [sFlt-1]), placental hormones (human placental lactogen, progesterone, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha), HbA1c, and creatinine were studied serially during pregnancy. RESULTS: FIR >/=15% were associated with an increased risk of the composite primary outcome (odds ratio [OR] 4.38 [95% CI 1.9-10.3]; P < 0.001), preeclampsia (OR 6.76 [95% CI 2.7-16.7]; P < 0.001), and was more common among women with type 1 diabetes (36.6 vs. 14.5%; P = 0.002). Creatinine was modestly elevated among women with FIR >/=15%; however, there was no difference in HbA1c. The ratio of sFlt-1 to PlGF was significantly higher among women with FIR at 25, 30, and 36 weeks, with differences maintained in the subgroup that developed preeclampsia. There was no difference in placental hormones between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first prospective study to associate FIR with altered expression of placental antiangiogenic factors and preeclampsia. FIR are an important clinical sign, among women with preexisting diabetes, that should alert the clinician to investigate underlying placental dysfunction.","type+1+diabetes"],["Factors associated with greater benefit of a national reimbursement policy for blood glucose test strips in adult patients with type 1 diabetes: A prospective cohort study.",["Jin SM","Baek JH","Suh S","Jung CH","Lee WJ","Park CY","Yang HK","Cho JH","Lee BW","Kim JH"],"J Diabetes Investig. 2017 Aug 10. doi: 10.1111/jdi.12728.","AIMS/INTRODUCTION: We aimed to identify factors independently associated with greater benefit of a national reimbursement policy for blood glucose test strips in adult patients with type 1 diabetes, in terms of glycemic control and the rate of severe hypoglycemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study of 466 adult patients with type 1 diabetes from five tertiary referral hospitals who registered for a national reimbursement program for blood glucose strips and were then followed-up for 12 months. Factors associated with a > 5% reduction in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and decreased rate of severe hypoglycemia (SH) at 12 months from baseline were evaluated. RESULTS: At the end of the 12 months of follow up, 158 of 466 patients (33.9%) achieved >5% reduction in HbA1c, and 47 of 111 patients (42.3%) had a decreased rate of SH relative to baseline. Higher HbA1c (P < 0.001), lower total daily insulin dose at baseline (P = 0.048) and an increase in self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) frequency during follow up (P = 0.001) were independently associated with >5% reduction in HbA1c. A higher SMBG frequency (P < 0.001), higher rate of SH at baseline (P = 0.029) and lack of hypoglycemic unawareness (P = 0.044) were independently associated with an increase in the frequency of SMBG during follow up. Higher SMBG frequency at baseline (P < 0.001) was independently associated with a decreased rate of SH. CONCLUSIONS: Several factors, including higher SMBG frequency at baseline, were independently associated with reduced HbA1c and a decreased rate of severe hypoglycemia, showing that patients with these characteristics derive the most benefit from reimbursement of blood glucose test strips.","type+1+diabetes"],["Insulin-producing cells derived from 'induced pluripotent stem cells' of patients with fulminant type 1 diabetes: Vulnerability to cytokine insults and increased expression of apoptosis-related genes.",["Hosokawa Y","Toyoda T","Fukui K","Baden MY","Funato M","Kondo Y","Sudo T","Iwahashi H","Kishida M","Okada C","Watanabe A","Asaka I","Osafune K","Imagawa A","Shimomura I"],"J Diabetes Investig. 2017 Aug 10. doi: 10.1111/jdi.12727.","AIMS/INTRODUCTION: The present study was carried out to generate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients with fulminant type 1 diabetes, and evaluate the cytokine-induced apoptotic reactions of beta-like insulin-producing cells differentiated from the iPSCs.

METHODS: This was a retrospective, observational cohort study using the MarketScan claims databases. The patients who were selected for the study had newly initiated treatment with an SGLT-2 inhibitor or a sulfonylurea between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2015 (index date; class of earliest medication is defined as the index class); were aged >/=18 years on the index date; were continuously enrolled with health insurance for 12 months before and 6 months after (ie, follow-up) the index date; and had >/=1 baseline diagnoses of type 2 diabetes. Study exclusions were type 1 diabetes, pregnancy, and gestational diabetes. Medication adherence was measured by the proportion of days covered (PDC) with the index class during the follow-up period and dichotomized as adherent (PDC >/=80%) or nonadherent. Persistence was defined as the number of days from the index date until a >60-day continuous gap in days without the index drug class (ie, discontinuation) or the end of follow-up. A propensity score model was used to match patients receiving an SGLT-2 inhibitor to patients receiving a sulfonylurea in a 1:1 ratio based on patient characteristics. Logistic (ie, adherence) and Cox (ie, persistence) regression models were fit to the matched samples. RESULTS: Initially, the study included 17,724 patients who received an SGLT-2 inhibitor and 25,490 patients who received a sulfonylurea. After propensity score matching, 13,657 patients remained in each cohort. Compared with patients receiving a sulfonylurea, a statistically significantly greater percentage of patients receiving an SGLT-2 inhibitor were adherent to therapy (61.4% vs 53.9%, respectively; odds ratio of adherence, 1.364; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.30-1.43; P <.001) and persistent (76.1% vs 68.9%, respectively; hazard ratio of discontinuation, 0.746; 95% CI, 0.71-0.78; P <.001).

Total cost per AE was calculated from a French national health insurance perspective and updated in 2017 Euros. Hospital stay costs were estimated based on public and private weighted tariffs and data from the French Medical Information System (Programme de Medicalisation des Systemes d'Information). Costs of tests, consultations and treatments were calculated based on national reimbursement tariffs. RESULTS: Overall, costs of grades 3 and 4 AEs related to treatment ranged from euro46 per event to euro7,742 per year. Fourteen out of 24 AEs identified had a mean estimated cost over euro2,000.

After oral administration of LBP (10, 20 or 40 mg/kg), sildenafil citrate (SC, 5 mg/kg) or saline for 62 consecutive days, the typical abnormal changes in the sperm parameters, in relative weight of reproductive organs and in morphology of testis were observed in diabetic mice. LBP treatment of the diabetic mice considerably reversed those changes and Johnsen's testicular score, serum testosterone (T), follicular stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) level were also increased to different degrees. Moreover, our data have also shown that a marked improvement in sexual behavior and fertility level after administration of LBP (40 mg/kg) compared to the diabetic group. These results suggested that LBP can exert functional recovery of male sexual dysfunction and fertility damages induced by diabetes in male mice, which is likely to be mediated through regulating the hypothalamus- pituitary-gonadal axis endocrine activity.","type+1+diabetes"],["Metabolic and immune effects of immunotherapy with proinsulin peptide in human new-onset type 1 diabetes.",["Alhadj Ali M","Liu YF","Arif S","Tatovic D","Shariff H","Gibson VB","Yusuf N","Baptista R","Eichmann M","Petrov N","Heck S","Yang JHM","Tree TIM","Pujol-Autonell I","Yeo L","Baumard LR","Stenson R","Howell A","Clark A","Boult Z","Powrie J","Adams L","Wong FS","Luzio S","Dunseath G","Green K","O'Keefe A","Bayly G","Thorogood N","Andrews R","Leech N","Joseph F","Nair S","Seal S","Cheung H","Beam C","Hills R","Peakman M","Dayan CM"],"Sci Transl Med. 2017 Aug 9;9(402). pii: eaaf7779. doi: 10.1126/scitranslmed.aaf7779.","Immunotherapy using short immunogenic peptides of disease-related autoantigens restores immune tolerance in preclinical disease models.

We previously reported that the treatment of diabetic animals (4 weeks of diabetes) with CaD, during the last 10 days of diabetes, prevents blood-retinal barrier breakdown. Here, we aimed to investigate whether later treatment of diabetic rats with CaD would reverse inflammatory processes in the retina. Diabetes was induced with streptozotocin, and 6 weeks after diabetes onset, CaD (100 mg/kg/day) was administered for 2 weeks. The treatment with CaD significantly increased glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) levels in the retina of nondiabetic animals (138.6 +/- 12.8% of control) and enhanced the diabetes-induced increase in GFAP levels (174.8 +/- 5.6% of control). In addition, CaD prevented the increase in mRNA and protein expression of tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1beta, as well as the formation of oxidized carbonyl residues and the increase in nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity, particularly in the ganglion cell layer of diabetic animals. We demonstrate that the treatment of diabetic animals with CaD can reverse the established proinflammatory processes in the retina. These beneficial effects appear to be attributed, at least partially, to the antioxidant properties of CaD.","type+1+diabetes"],["Standard body mass index reference data of prepubescent diabetic Egyptian children.",["Hassan NE","El-Masry SA","Khalil A"],"J Pediatr Endocrinol Metab. 2017 Aug 28;30(9):909-915. doi: 10.1515/jpem-2017-0089.","BACKGROUND: Data on the growth of diabetic children is conflicting. The aim of this study was to create and validate acceptable body mass index (BMI)-standardized percentiles and curves applied to Egyptian prepubescent diabetic children. METHODS: The cross-sectional study comprised 822 prepubescent children with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), whose ages ranged from 3 years to 10 years+/-6 months. An anthropometric assessment for each child was performed: body weight, height and BMI were calculated (weight [kg]/height [m2]), and glycated hemoglobin levels were determined. Means+/-standard deviations (SDs) and the smoothed percentiles of the BMI from age 3-10 years, by sex, for total, controlled and uncontrolled diabetic children were calculated. Comparisons of the 50th percentiles for the controlled and uncontrolled diabetic children, by sex, with those of the Egyptian and World Health Organization (WHO) growth curves were made. RESULTS: For controlled diabetic males and females, the 50th percentile BMI was higher than those of the Egyptian and WHO growth curves, while differences in BMI were recorded for uncontrolled diabetic males and females. For uncontrolled diabetic males, the BMI was lower than the standard Egyptian and WHO growth curves up to 5 years of age, after which it became higher than the standard WHO and lower than the standard Egyptian growth curves from 5 years up to 10 years of age.

Autoimmune diseases are typically treated with broad immunosuppression, but this has multiple disadvantages. Induction of antigen-specific tolerance is preferable. The application of nanomedicine to the problem of T1D can take different forms, but one promising way is the development of tolerogenic nanoparticles, the aim of which is to mitigate the islet-destroying autoimmunity. We review the topic and highlight recent strategies to produce tolerogenic nanoparticles for the purpose of treating T1D. RECENT FINDINGS: Several groups are making progress in applying tolerogenic nanoparticles to rodent models of T1D, while others are using nanotechnology to aid other potential T1D treatments such as islet transplant and islet encapsulation. The strategies behind how nanoparticles achieve tolerance are varied. It is likely the future will see even greater diversity in tolerance induction strategies as well as a greater focus on how to translate this technology from preclinical use in mice to treatment of T1D in humans.","type+1+diabetes"],["Association of preterm birth and small for gestational age with metabolic outcomes in children and adolescents: A population-based cohort study from Taiwan.",["Huang YT","Lin HY","Wang CH","Su BH","Lin CC"],"Pediatr Neonatol. 2017 Jul 25. pii: S1875-9572(17)30043-8. doi: 10.1016/j.pedneo.2017.07.007.","BACKGROUND: Previous studies have identified preterm birth and/or small for gestational age (SGA) as risk factors for features of the metabolic syndrome, including high blood pressure, insulin sensitivity and atherosclerosis, occurring later in life, with controversial results.

We have previously shown that loss of PTPN22 results in decreased NLRP3 (NLR family pyrin domain containing 3) activation and that this effect is mediated via enhanced NLRP3 phosphorylation. However, it is unclear how phosphorylation of NLRP3 mediates its inhibition. Here, we demonstrate that loss of macroautophagy/autophagy abrogates the inhibitory effect on NLRP3 activation observed upon loss of PTPN22. Phosphorylated, but not nonphosphorylated NLRP3 is found in autophagosomes, indicating that NLRP3 phosphorylation mediates its inactivation via promoting sequestration into phagophores, the precursors to autophagosomes. This finding shows that autophagy and NLRP3 inflammasome activation are connected, and that PTPN22 plays a key role in the regulation of those 2 pathways.

We evaluated the role of lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG3; CD223) on Tregs by generating mice in which LAG3 is absent on the cell surface of Tregs in a murine model of type 1 diabetes. Unexpectedly, mice that lacked LAG3 expression on Tregs exhibited reduced autoimmune diabetes, consistent with enhanced Treg proliferation and function. Whereas the transcriptional landscape of peripheral wild-type (WT) and Lag3-deficient Tregs was largely comparable, substantial differences between intra-islet Tregs were evident and involved a subset of genes and pathways that promote Treg maintenance and function. Consistent with these observations, Lag3-deficient Tregs outcompeted WT Tregs in the islets but not in the periphery in cotransfer experiments because of enhanced interleukin-2-signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 signaling and increased Eos expression. Our study suggests that LAG3 intrinsically limits Treg proliferation and function at inflammatory sites, promotes autoimmunity in a chronic autoimmune-prone environment, and may contribute to Treg insufficiency in autoimmune disease.","type+1+diabetes"],["Downregulated NLRP3 and NLRP1 inflammasomes signaling pathways in the development and progression of type 1 diabetes mellitus.",["Liu H","Xu R","Kong Q","Liu J","Yu Z","Zhao C"],"Biomed Pharmacother. 2017 Oct;94:619-626. doi: 10.1016/j.biopha.2017.07.102.

The third diabetic group (D) was not operated. At the end of the experimental period, rats were sacrificed, C-reactive protein (CRP) and calprotectin levels were measured in the serum and colon tissue specimens. Tissue specimens were also analyzed histologically. We found that serum and colon calprotectin levels were elevated in the D+I group compared to the D and/or I group alone, but relatively calprotectin levels increased in I as compared to C group in colon tissues. CRP levels were significantly increased with ischemic colitis in diabetes, while colon CRP levels were decreased. These results provide evidence for the existence of inflammation in the STZ-induced diabetic rats with ischemic colitis. In conclusion, our measurements of serum calprotectin levels of STZ-induced diabetic rats with ischemic colitis provide a practical approach for an early diagnosis of ischemic colitis.

Future studies would be desirable to further strengthen the role of calprotectin in the early diagnosis of ischemic colitis in diabetics clinical settings.","type+1+diabetes"],["Effect of real-time continuous glucose monitoring on hypoglycemia in adult type 1 diabetes patients.",["Jia W"],"J Diabetes Investig. 2017 Aug 5. doi: 10.1111/jdi.12722.","In this manuscript, the application of CGM in hypoglycemia management in adult type 1 diabetes was commented and discussed.","type+1+diabetes"],["Clinic variation in glycaemic control for children with Type 1 diabetes in England and Wales: a population-based, multilevel analysis.",["Charalampopoulos D","Amin R","Warner JT","Muniz-Terrera G","Mazarello Paes V","Viner RM","Stephenson T"],"Diabet Med. 2017 Aug 5. doi: 10.1111/dme.13442.","AIM: To understand the scope for improving children's glycaemic outcomes by reducing variation between clinics and examine the role of insulin regimen and clinic characteristics. METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of 2012-2013 National Paediatric Diabetes Audit data from 21 773 children aged < 19 years with Type 1 diabetes cared for at 176 clinics organized into 11 regional diabetes networks in England and Wales. Variation in HbA1c was explored by multilevel models with a random effect for clinic. The impact of clinic context was quantified by computing the per cent of total variation in HbA1c which occurs between clinics (intraclass correlation coefficient; ICC). RESULTS: Overall, 69 of the 176 diabetes clinics (39%) had a glycaemic performance that differed significantly from the national average after adjusting for patient case-mix with respect to age, gender, diabetes duration, deprivation and ethnicity. However, differences between clinics accounted for 4.7% of the total variation in HbA1c . Inclusion of within-clinic HbA1c standard deviation led to a substantial reduction in ICC to 2.4%. Insulin regimen, clinic volume and diabetes networks had a small or moderate impact on ICC. CONCLUSIONS: Differences between diabetes clinics accounted for only a small portion of the total variation in glycaemic control because most of the variation was within clinics. This implies that national glycaemic improvements might best be achieved not only by targeting poor centres but also by shifting the whole distribution of clinics to higher levels of quality.","type+1+diabetes"],["Temporal changes in the exercise pressor reflex in type 1 diabetic rats.",["Grotle AK","Garcia EA","Huo Y","Stone AJ"],"Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol. 2017 Oct 1;313(4):H708-H714. doi: 10.1152/ajpheart.00399.2017.

However, the effect of type 1 diabetes (T1DM) on this reflex is not known. We examined, in decerebrate male and female T1DM [streptozotocin (STZ)] and healthy control (CTL) rats, pressor and cardioaccelerator responses to isometric contraction of the hindlimb muscles during the early and late stages of the disease. STZ (50 mg/kg) was injected to induce diabetes, and experiments were conducted at 1, 3, and 6 wk after injection. On the day of the experiment, we statically contracted the hindlimb muscles by stimulating the sciatic nerve and measured changes in mean arterial pressure and heart rate. We found that the pressor but not cardioaccelerator response was exaggerated in STZ rats at 1 wk (STZ: 21 +/- 3 mmHg, n = 10, and CTL: 14 +/- 2 mmHg, n = 10, P < 0.05) and at 3 wk (STZ: 26 +/- 5 mmHg, n = 10, and CTL: 17 +/- 3 mmHg, n = 11, P < 0.05) after injection. However, at 6 wk, and only in male rats, both the pressor (STZ: 13 +/- 3 mmHg, n = 12, and CTL: 17 +/- 3 mmHg, n = 13, P < 0.05) and cardioaccelerator responses (STZ: 7 +/- 3 beats/min, n = 12, and CTL: 10 +/- 3 beats/min, n = 13, P < 0.05) to contraction were significantly attenuated in STZ rats compared with CTL rats. These data indicate that T1DM exaggerates the exercise pressor reflex during the early stages of the disease in both male and female rats. Conversely, T1DM attenuates this reflex in the late stage of the disease in male but not female rats.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This is the first study to provide evidence that the pressor and cardioaccelerator responses to skeletal muscle contraction vary depending on the duration of type 1 diabetes.","type+1+diabetes"],["Is Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus More Prevalent Than Expected in Transgender Persons?

We found that long-term PDL induced significant beta-cell dedifferentiation, followed by a time-dependent decrease in functional beta-cell mass-all specifically in the ligated tail portion of the pancreas (PDL-tail). High levels of transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFbeta1) were detected in the PDL-tail and were mainly produced by M2 macrophages at the early stage and by activated myofibroblasts at the later stage. Loss of beta-cell mass was then found to result from TGFbeta1-triggered epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by beta-cells, rather than resulting directly from beta-cell apoptosis. Mechanistically, TGFbeta1-treated beta-cells activated expression of the EMT regulator gene Snail in a SMAD3/Stat3-dependent manner. Moreover, forced expression of forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1), an antagonist for activated Stat3, specifically in beta-cells ameliorated beta-cell EMT and beta-cell loss and prevented the onset of diabetes in mice undergoing PDL. Together, our data suggest that chronic pancreatitis may trigger TGFbeta1-mediated beta-cell EMT to lead to CPRD, which could substantially be prevented by sustained expression of FoxO1 in beta-cells.","type+1+diabetes"],["Heart rate variability in fetuses of type 1 diabetes pregnancies.",["Hamoud Y","de Jonckheere J","Vambergue A","Houfflin-Debarge V","Storme L","Flocteil M","Deruelle P","Garabedian C"],"Diabetes Metab. 2017 Jul 31. pii: S1262-3636(17)30474-3. doi: 10.1016/j.diabet.2017.07.002.","","type+1+diabetes"],["Dendritic cell recruitment and activation in autoimmunity.",["Sozzani S","Del Prete A","Bosisio D"],"J Autoimmun. 2017 Jul 31. pii: S0896-8411(17)30502-4. doi: 10.1016/j.jaut.2017.07.012.","Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigen presenting cells displaying the unique capability to activate naive T cells. DCs react to pathogen encounter also by the production of mediators of inflammation, including pro-inflammatory cytokines. Because of this complex role, any imbalance in DC function reflects into defective or exaggerated immune response and tissue damage. DCs comprise two main subsets, namely conventional or classical DCs (cDCs), that are dedicated antigen presenting cells, and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), that respond to nucleic acids by releasing high amounts of type I interferons (IFNs). Since the formal demonstration that DC can prime autoreactive naive T cells, a full body of evidence has implicated DCs in virtually all manifestations of autoimmunity, although their exact pathogenic role often remains poorly characterized. The recent availability of progressively more refined strategies of constitutive and inducible DC ablation is contributing in defining the precise role of DCs at least in some autoimmune disease models. This review aims at critically summarizing the current literature concerning selected aspects of DC biology that, when altered, facilitate autoimmunity. These aspects include: i) mechanisms of tissue entry and accumulation, ii) mechanisms of activation and iii) orchestration of the immune balance by cytokine production. A special focus will be on inappropriate DC activation by signals released by damaged tissues via innate immune receptors, such as Toll-like receptors. These signals are responsible, in pDCs, for exaggerated type I IFN production, the hallmark of a set of apparently distant autoimmune conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus and type 1 diabetes; whereas in cDCs, they trigger DC rapid maturation and Th1/Th17 cytokine secretion. Tissue-derived molecules also contribute to further promote tissue damage and autoantigen spreading, possibly through pDC-derived Granzyme B secretion. Finally, the therapeutic possibilities based on DC targeting in human autoimmune diseases will be briefly summarized.","type+1+diabetes"],["Moving beyond subcutaneous insulin: the application of adjunctive therapies to the treatment of type 1 diabetes.",["Ang KH","Sherr JL"],"Expert Opin Drug Deliv. 2017 Sep;14(9):1113-1131. doi: 10.1080/17425247.2017.1360862.

Despite the advances that have been made, the vast majority of those living with T1D still struggle to achieve targeted control. Yet, a plethora of agents have been developed to treat those with Type 2 Diabetes. Exploration of how these agents may benefit those with T1D has been an area of intense investigation, especially due to the overweight/obesity epidemic, which now afflicts more than 60% of those living with T1D. Areas covered: This review focuses on agents that have been utilized, including inhaled insulin preparations, pramlintide, metformin, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, and dual SGLT1/2 inhibitors. Furthermore, with approval of the first hybrid closed loop (CL) system, the development of dual hormone CL systems is being explored. While the most common agent applied to these dual systems has been glucagon, research has been conducted to assess how some of the adjunctive therapies described above could aide with achieving postprandial glucose control while on CL insulin delivery. Expert opinion: By becoming less insulin-centric and incorporating some of these other agents, it is possible we may be able to better combat T1D.","type+1+diabetes"],["Remission Phase in Paediatric Type 1 Diabetes: New Understanding and Emerging Biomarkers.",["Fonolleda M","Murillo M","Vazquez F","Bel J","Vives-Pi M"],"Horm Res Paediatr. 2017 Aug 3. doi: 10.1159/000479030.","Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a metabolic disease of unknown aetiology that results from the autoimmune destruction of the beta-cells. Clinical onset with classic hyperglycaemic symptoms occurs much more frequently in children and young adults, when less than 30% of beta-cells remain. Exogenous insulin administration is the only treatment for patients. However, due to glucose dysregulation, severe complications develop gradually. Recently, an increase in T1D incidence has been reported worldwide, especially in children. Shortly after diagnosis, T1D patients often experience partial remission called \"honeymoon phase,\" which lasts a few months, with minor requirements of exogenous insulin. In this stage, the remaining beta-cells are still able to produce enough insulin to reduce the administration of exogenous insulin. A recovery of immunological tolerance to beta-cell autoantigens could explain the regeneration attempt in this remission phase. This mini-review focuses on the remission phase in childhood T1D. Understanding this period and finding those peripheral biomarkers that are signs of immunoregulation or islet regeneration could contribute to the identification of patients with a better glycaemic prognosis and a lower risk of secondary complications. This remission phase could be a good checkpoint for the administration of future immunotherapies.","type+1+diabetes"],["Utilisation of prehospital emergency medical services for hyperglycaemia: A community-based observational study.",["Villani M","Nanayakkara N","Ranasinha S","Earnest A","Smith K","Soldatos G","Teede H","Zoungas S"],"PLoS One. 2017 Aug 3;12(8):e0182413. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0182413. eCollection 2017.","AIMS: This study examines prehospital Emergency Medical Service (EMS) utilisation and patterns of demand for hyperglycaemia management, including characteristics of individuals and factors related to hospital transport. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A state-wide, community-based observational study of all patients requiring prehospital EMS for hyperglycaemia during a 7 year study period (Jan 2009-Dec 2015) using electronic data from the Ambulance Victoria data warehouse was conducted. Pre-specified variables related to patient demographics, comorbidities, examination findings, paramedic treatment and transport outcomes were obtained. Logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with transport to hospital. RESULTS: There were 11,417 cases of hyperglycaemia attended by paramedics during the study period, accounting for 0.3-0.4% of the total annual EMS caseload, and equating to 0.54 attendances per 100 people with diabetes in the state of Victoria, Australia, per year. There was a significant increase in annual utilisation, with a rate ratio of 1.62 between 2009 (2.42 cases per 10,000 population) and 2015 (3.91 cases per 10,000 population). Fifty-one percent of cases had type 2 diabetes, 37% had type 1 diabetes, 4% had diabetes with the type unspecified and 8% had no recorded history of diabetes. Ninety percent of cases were transported to hospital. Factors associated with increased odds of transport to hospital included no known history of diabetes, regional/rural locations, case time between 0600 and <1800 hours, increasing number of comorbidities and increasingly unstable vital sign observations. CONCLUSION: There is substantial utilisation of prehospital EMS for hyperglycaemia.

Here, we compared two nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse colonies, NODlow and NODhigh, differing markedly in their cumulative T1D incidence (22% vs. 90% by 30 weeks in females). NODhigh mice harbored more complex intestinal microbiota, including several pathobionts; both colonies harbored segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB), thought to suppress T1D. Young NODhigh females had increased B-cell activation in their mesenteric lymph nodes. These phenotypes were transmissible. Co-housing of NODlow with NODhigh mice after weaning did not change T1D development, but T1D incidence was increased in female offspring of co-housed NODlow mice, which were exposed to the NODhigh environment both before and after weaning. These offspring also acquired microbiota and B-cell activation approaching those of NODhigh mice. In NODlow females, the low rate of T1D was unaffected by cyclophosphamide but increased by PD-L1 blockade. Thus, environmental exposures that are innocuous later in life may promote T1D progression if acquired early during immune development, possibly by altering B-cell activation and/or PD-L1 function. Moreover, T1D suppression in NOD mice by SFB may depend on the presence of other microbial influences. The complexity of microbial immune regulation revealed in this murine model may also be relevant to the environmental regulation of human T1D.","type+1+diabetes"],["Frequency and risk factors of depression in type 1 diabetes in a developing country.",["Khater D","Omar M"],"J Pediatr Endocrinol Metab. 2017 Aug 28;30(9):917-922. doi: 10.1515/jpem-2016-0414.","BACKGROUND: Living with type 1 diabetes, especially in developing countries, can feel overwhelming for parents and children because constant vigilance is required for proper care with an inadequacy of resources.

RESULTS: In total, 87,327 parent-reported respiratory infectious episodes were recorded while the children were under study surveillance for islet autoimmunity, and 454 children seroconverted. The number of respiratory infections occurring in a 9 month period was associated with the subsequent risk of autoimmunity (p < 0.001). For each 1/year rate increase in infections, the hazard of islet autoimmunity increased by 5.6% (95% CI 2.5%, 8.8%). The risk association was linked primarily to infections occurring in the winter (HR 1.42 [95% CI 1.16, 1.74]; p < 0.001). The types of respiratory infection independently associated with autoimmunity were common cold, influenza-like illness, sinusitis, and laryngitis/tracheitis, with HRs (95% CI) of 1.38 (1.11, 1.71), 2.37 (1.35, 4.15), 2.63 (1.22, 5.67) and 1.76 (1.04, 2.98), respectively. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Recent respiratory infections in young children correlate with an increased risk of islet autoimmunity in the TEDDY study. Further studies to identify the potential causative viruses with pathogen-specific assays should focus especially on the 9 month time window leading to autoantibody seroconversion.","type+1+diabetes"],["Regulatory T cell dysfunction in type 1 diabetes: what's broken and how can we fix it?",["Hull CM","Peakman M","Tree TIM"],"Diabetologia. 2017 Aug 2. doi: 10.1007/s00125-017-4377-1.","Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease characterised by the destruction of insulin producing beta cells in the pancreas. Whilst it remains unclear what the original triggering factors for this destruction are, observations from the natural history of human type 1 diabetes, including incidence rates in twins, suggest that the disease results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Whilst many different immune cells have been implicated, including members of the innate and adaptive immune systems, a view has emerged over the past 10 years that beta cell damage is mediated by the combined actions of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with specificity for islet autoantigens. In health, these potentially pathogenic T cells are held in check by multiple regulatory mechanisms, known collectively as 'immunological tolerance'. This raises the question as to whether type 1 diabetes develops, at least in part, as a result of a defect in one or more of these control mechanisms. Immunological tolerance includes both central mechanisms (purging of the T cell repertoire of high-affinity autoreactive T cells in the thymus) and peripheral mechanisms, a major component of which is the action of a specialised subpopulation of T cells, known as regulatory T cells (Tregs). In this review, we highlight the evidence suggesting that a reduction in the functional capacity of different Treg populations contributes to disease development in type 1 diabetes. We also address current controversies regarding the putative causes of this defect and discuss strategies to correct it as a means to reduce or prevent islet destruction in a clinical setting.","type+1+diabetes"],["The modulation of enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase from dendritic cells for the treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus.",["Abram DM","Fernandes LGR","Ramos Filho ACS","Simioni PU"],"Drug Des Devel Ther. 2017 Jul 24;11:2171-2178. doi: 10.2147/DDDT.S135367. eCollection 2017.","Diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1) is an autoimmune disease in which beta-cells of the pancreas islet are destroyed by T lymphocytes. Specific T cells are activated by antigen-presenting cells, mainly dendritic cells (DCs). It is already known that the regulation of tryptophan pathway in DC can be a mechanism of immunomodulation. The enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is present in many cells, including DC, and participates in the metabolism of the amino acid tryptophan. Recent studies suggest the involvement of IDO in the modulation of immune response, which became more evident after the in vitro demonstration of IDO production by DC and of the ability of these cells to inhibit lymphocyte function through the control of tryptophan metabolism. Current studies on immunotherapies describe the use of DC and IDO to control the progression of the immune response that triggers DM1. The initial results obtained are promising and indicate the possibility of developing therapies for the treatment or prevention of the DM1. Clinical trials using these cells in DM1 patients represent an interesting alternative treatment. However, clinical trials are still in the initial phase and a robust group of assays is necessary.","type+1+diabetes"],["Generalized Status Epilepticus in a Patient with Acute-onset Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus Associated with Severe Kidney Dysfunction: A Case Report and Literature Review.",["Ohara N","Koda R","Watanabe H","Iino N","Ohashi K","Terajima K","Ozawa T","Ikeda Y","Sekiguchi H","Ohashi H","Yamaguchi S"],"Intern Med. 2017;56(15):1993-1999. doi: 10.2169/internalmedicine.56.8304.

The role of vitamin D in innate and adaptive immunity is critical. A statistical error in the estimation of the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for vitamin D was recently discovered; in a correct analysis of the data used by the Institute of Medicine, it was found that 8895 IU/d was needed for 97.5% of individuals to achieve values >/=50 nmol/L. Another study confirmed that 6201 IU/d was needed to achieve 75 nmol/L and 9122 IU/d was needed to reach 100 nmol/L. The largest meta-analysis ever conducted of studies published between 1966 and 2013 showed that 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels <75 nmol/L may be too low for safety and associated with higher all-cause mortality, demolishing the previously presumed U-shape curve of mortality associated with vitamin D levels. Since all-disease mortality is reduced to 1.0 with serum vitamin D levels >/=100 nmol/L, we call public health authorities to consider designating as the RDA at least three-fourths of the levels proposed by the Endocrine Society Expert Committee as safe upper tolerable daily intake doses. This could lead to a recommendation of 1000 IU for children <1 year on enriched formula and 1500 IU for breastfed children older than 6 months, 3000 IU for children >1 year of age, and around 8000 IU for young adults and thereafter.

This pessimistic point of view may have come about by using non-validated methods for measuring blood pressure in pregnancy combined with inadequate methodology for diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring effects. AIM: To determine the association between AASI in women with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and preeclampsia, and to assess the ability of AASI to diagnose preeclampsia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Repeated 24-h ambulatory blood pressure recordings were performed three times during pregnancy and once three months postpartum in 151 women with T1DM and 50 control women without diabetes. Circadian rhythm was evaluated as the night day ratio, night blood pressure divided by day blood pressure. RESULTS: Of the T1DM women, 33 developed preeclampsia, which was associated with AASI in the 3rd trimester (p<0.05). The best predictor of preeclampsia in T1DM was an AASI of 0.35. The diurnal blood pressure was significantly higher in all trimesters in women who later had preeclampsia. A flattened circadian rhythm was present in T1DM women with preeclampsia compared to women without preeclampsia (night-day ratio: systole 2nd trimester: 0.94+/-0.07 vs. 0.91+/-0.05, women with and without preeclampsia, respectively, p=0.015; diastole 2nd trimester: 0.89+/-0.07 vs. 0.85+/-0.07, p=0.003). AASI was higher during pregnancy compared to postpartum in women with T1DM (0.31+/-0.16, 0.31+/-0.16 and 0.33+/-0.18 vs. 0.25+/-0.17; 1st, 2nd and 3rd trimester vs. postpartum). CONCLUSION: Women with T1DM and preeclampsia demonstrate increased arterial stiffness and had early manifestations in the non-dipping of blood pressure.","type+1+diabetes"],["Prediction of glycaemic control in young children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus using mixed-effects logistic regression modelling.",["van Esdonk MJ","Tai B","Cotterill A","Charles B","Hennig S"],"PLoS One. 2017 Aug 2;12(8):e0182181. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0182181. eCollection 2017.","OBJECTIVES: Glycaemic control in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus can be challenging, complex and influenced by many factors. This study aimed to identify patient characteristics that were predictive of satisfactory glycaemic control in the paediatric population using a logistic regression mixed-effects (population) modelling approach. METHODS: The data were obtained from 288 patients aged between 1 and 22 years old recorded retrospectively over 3 years (1852 HbA1c observations). HbA1c status was categorised as 'satisfactory' or 'unsatisfactory' glycaemic control, using an a priori cut-off value of HbA1c >/= 9% (75 mmol/mol), as used routinely by the hospital's endocrine paediatricians. Patients' characteristics were tested as covariates in the model as potential predictors of glycaemic control. RESULTS: There were three patient characteristics identified as having a significant influence on glycaemic control: HbA1c measurement at the beginning of the observation period (Odds Ratio (OR) = 0.30 per 1% HbA1c increase, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.20-0.41); Age (OR = 0.88 per year increase, 95% CI = 0.80-0.94), and fractional disease duration (disease duration/age, OR = 0.80 per 0.10 increase, 95% CI = 0.66-0.93) were collectively identified as factors contributing significantly to lower the probability of satisfactory glycaemic control. CONCLUSIONS: The study outcomes may prove useful for identifying paediatric patients at risk of having unsatisfactory glycaemic control, and who could require more extensive monitoring, support, or targeted interventions.","type+1+diabetes"],["Bleeding out the quality-adjusted life years: evaluating the burden of primary dysmenorrhea using time trade-off and willingness-to-pay methods.",["Rencz F","Pentek M","Stalmeier PFM","Brodszky V","Ruzsa G","Gradvohl E","Baji P","Gulacsi L"],"Pain. 2017 Nov;158(11):2259-2267. doi: 10.1097/j.pain.0000000000001028.","Primary dysmenorrhea (PD), or painful menstruation in the absence of identified uterine pathology, affects 5 to 9 in every 10 reproductive-aged women. Despite its high prevalence, just a few studies with very small patient numbers have focused on health-related quality of life impairment in PD. We aimed to assess health-related quality of life values for a severe and a mild hypothetical PD health state using 10-year time trade-off and willingness-to-pay methods. In 2015, a nationwide convenience sample of women, aged between 18 and 40 years, was recruited using an Internet-based cross-sectional survey in Hungary. Respondents with a known history of secondary dysmenorrhea were excluded. Data on 1836 and 160 women, with and without a history of PD, respectively, were analysed. Mean utility values for the severe and mild health states were 0.85 (median 0.95) and 0.94 (median 1), respectively. Participants were willing to pay a mean of &OV0556;1127 (median &OV0556;161) and &OV0556;142 (median &OV0556;16) for a complete cure from the severe and mild PD health states. Compared with the non-PD group, women with PD valued both health states worse according to willingness to pay (P < 0.05) but similar in the time trade-off. It seems that PD substantially contributes to the quality-adjusted life year loss in this age group, which is comparable with losses from chronic diseases such as type 1 diabetes, asthma, atopic eczema, or chronic migraine. Our findings provide a useful input to cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analyses of PD treatments.","type+1+diabetes"],["Closed-Loop Control Without Meal Announcement in Type 1 Diabetes.",["Cameron FM","Ly TT","Buckingham BA","Maahs DM","Forlenza GP","Levy CJ","Lam D","Clinton P","Messer LH","Westfall E","Levister C","Xie YY","Baysal N","Howsmon D","Patek SD","Bequette BW"],"Diabetes Technol Ther. 2017 Sep;19(9):527-532. doi: 10.1089/dia.2017.0078.

Our goal was to assess initial safety and efficacy of this system. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The multiple model probabilistic controller (MMPPC) anticipates meals when the patient is awake. The controller used the subject's basal rates and total daily insulin dose for initialization. The system was tested at two sites on 10 patients in a 30-h inpatient study, followed by 15 subjects at three sites in a 54-h supervised hotel study, where the controller was challenged by exercise and unannounced meals. The system was implemented on the UVA DiAs system using a Roche Spirit Combo Insulin Pump and a Dexcom G4 Continuous Glucose Monitor. RESULTS: The mean overall (24-h basis) and nighttime (11 PM-7 AM) continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) values were 142 and 125 mg/dL during the inpatient study. The hotel study used a different daytime tuning and manual announcement, instead of automatic detection, of sleep and wake periods. This resulted in mean overall (24-h basis) and nighttime CGM values of 152 and 139 mg/dL for the hotel study and there was also a reduction in hypoglycemia events from 1.6 to 0.91 events/patient/day. CONCLUSIONS: The MMPPC system achieved a mean glucose that would be particularly helpful for people with an elevated A1c as a result of frequent missed meal boluses. Current full closed loop has a higher risk for hypoglycemia when compared with algorithms using meal announcement.","type+1+diabetes"]],"arguments":{},"addedWidgets":{},"removedWidgets":[],"schema":[{"name":"title","type":"\"string\"","metadata":"{}"},{"name":"authors","type":"{\"type\":\"array\",\"elementType\":\"string\",\"containsNull\":true}","metadata":"{}"},{"name":"source","type":"\"string\"","metadata":"{}"},{"name":"text","type":"\"string\"","metadata":"{}"},{"name":"topic","type":"\"string\"","metadata":"{}"}],"overflow":true,"aggData":[],"aggSchema":[],"aggOverflow":false,"aggSeriesLimitReached":false,"aggError":"","aggType":"","plotOptions":null,"isJsonSchema":true,"dbfsResultPath":null,"datasetInfos":[]},"errorSummary":"Command

(AP) systems are best positioned for optimal treatment of type 1 diabetes (T1D) and are currently being tested in outpatient clinical trials. Our consortium developed and tested a novel adaptive AP in an outpatient, single-arm, uncontrolled multicenter clinical trial lasting 12 weeks. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Thirty adults with T1D completed a continuous glucose monitor (CGM)-augmented 1-week sensor-augmented pump (SAP) period. After the AP was started, basal insulin delivery settings used by the AP for initialization were adapted weekly, and carbohydrate ratios were adapted every 4 weeks by an algorithm running on a cloud-based server, with automatic data upload from devices. Adaptations were reviewed by expert study clinicians and patients. The primary end point was change in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). Outcomes are reported adhering to consensus recommendations on reporting of AP trials. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients completed the trial. HbA1c, 7.0 +/- 0.8% at the start of AP use, improved to 6.7 +/- 0.6% after 12 weeks (-0.3, 95% CI -0.5 to -0.2, P < 0.001). Compared with the SAP run in, CGM time spent in the hypoglycemic range improved during the day from 5.0 to 1.9% (-3.1, 95% CI -4.1 to -2.1, P < 0.001) and overnight from 4.1 to 1.1% (-3.1, 95% CI -4.2 to -1.9, P < 0.001). Whereas carbohydrate ratios were adapted to a larger extent initially with minimal changes thereafter, basal insulin was adapted throughout. Approximately 10% of adaptation recommendations were manually overridden. There were no protocol-related serious adverse events.

doi: 10.1111/acel.12694.","Inflammaging plays an important role in most age-related diseases. However, the mechanism of inflammaging is largely unknown, and therapeutic control of inflammaging is challenging. Human alpha-1 antitrypsin (hAAT) has immune-regulatory, anti-inflammatory, and cytoprotective properties as demonstrated in several disease models including type 1 diabetes, arthritis, lupus, osteoporosis, and stroke. To test the potential anti-inflammaging effect of hAAT, we generated transgenic Drosophila lines expressing hAAT. Surprisingly, the lifespan of hAAT-expressing lines was significantly longer than that of genetically matched controls. To understand the mechanism underlying the anti-aging effect of hAAT, we monitored the expression of aging-associated genes and found that aging-induced expressions of Relish (NF-kB orthologue) and Diptericin were significantly lower in hAAT lines than in control lines. RNA-seq analysis revealed that innate immunity genes regulated by NF-kB were significantly and specifically inhibited in hAAT transgenic Drosophila lines. To confirm this anti-inflammaging effect in human cells, we treated X-ray-induced senescence cells with hAAT and showed that hAAT treatment significantly decreased the expression and maturation of IL-6 and IL-8, two major factors of senescence-associated secretory phenotype. Consistent with results from Drosophila,RNA-seq analysis also showed that hAAT treatment significantly inhibited inflammation related genes and pathways. Together, our results demonstrated that hAAT significantly inhibited inflammaging in both Drosophila and human cell models.

10.1039/c7bm00790f.","Type-1 Diabetes (T1D) is a devastating autoimmune disorder which results in the destruction of beta cells within the pancreas. A promising treatment strategy for T1D is the replacement of the lost beta cell mass through implantation of immune-isolated microencapsulated islets referred to as the bioartificial pancreas. The goal of this approach is to restore blood glucose regulation and prevent the long-term comorbidities of T1D without the need for immunosuppressants. A major requirement in the quest to achieve this goal is to address the oxygen needs of islet cells. Islets are highly metabolically active and require a significant amount of oxygen for normal function. During the process of isolation, microencapsulation, and processing prior to transplantation, the islets' oxygen supply is disrupted, and a large amount of islet cells are therefore lost due to extended hypoxia, thus creating a major barrier to clinical success with this treatment. In this work, we have investigated the oxygen generating compounds, sodium percarbonate (SPO) and calcium peroxide (CPO) as potential supplemental oxygen sources for islets during isolation and encapsulation before and immediately after transplantation. First, SPO particles were used as an oxygen source for islets during isolation. Secondly, silicone films containing SPO were used to provide supplemental oxygen to islets for up to 4 days in culture. Finally, CPO was used as an oxygen source for encapsulated cells by co-encapsulating CPO particles with islets in permselective alginate microspheres.

coupling in type 1 diabetes: arterial stiffness is associated with impaired global longitudinal strain in type 1 diabetes patients-the Thousand & 1 Study.",["Theilade S","Rossing P","Jensen JS","Jensen MT"],"Acta Diabetol. 2017 Oct 16. doi: 10.1007/s00592-017-1062-2.","AIMS: Diabetes is associated with higher arterial stiffness-an early marker of cardiovascular disease. The coupling between arterial stiffness and myocardial function is still unresolved. We investigate associations between arterial stiffness and early myocardial impairment assessed with advanced echocardiography. METHODS: In 305 type 1 diabetes (T1D) patients without known heart disease and with normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (biplane LVEF > 45%), we measured arterial stiffness as pulse wave velocity (PWV) and performed conventional and speckle-tracking echocardiography assessing global longitudinal strain (GLS) as a measure of systolic myocardial function. Associations between PWV and myocardial function were reported as standardized beta values from adjusted regression models including age, sex, mean arterial pressure, body mass index, HbA1c, diabetes duration, estimated glomerular filtration rate, degree of albuminuria, total cholesterol, heart rate and smoking. RESULTS: Patients were 54 (12) years [mean (SD)], 152 (50%) females, diabetes duration 31 (16) years, HbA1c 65 (12) mmol/mol, LVEF 58 (5) %, GLS -18.2 (2.6) % and PWV 10.2 (3.4) m/s. There was no association between PWV and LVEF (p = 0.93). Conversely, there was a highly significant association between PWV and GLS in crude and multivariable models (standardized beta-coefficient 0.25, p < 0.001 and 0.16, p = 0.036, respectively). Also, diastolic function measured as E/e' was highly associated with PWV in crude and multivariable models (standardized beta-coefficient 0.43, p < 0.001 and 0.17, p = 0.016, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In T1D patients with normal LVEF and without known heart disease, higher arterial stiffness is independently associated with early systolic and diastolic myocardial impairment detectable by advanced echocardiography.

of Beta Cell Mass and Function by AIRmax and IVGTT in High Risk Subjects for Type 1 Diabetes.",["Hao W","Wookwyk A","Beam C","Bahnson T","Palmer JP","Greenbaum CJ"],"J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2017 Oct 12. doi: 10.1210/jc.2017-01713.","Context: There is little information regarding beta cell mass in individuals at early stages of type 1 diabetes (T1D). Objective: To investigate both AIRmax, as a correlate of beta cell mass, and beta cell function by IVGTT in subjects at early stages of T1D. Design/Setting/Participants: Forty subjects were enrolled: (1) low risk group: relatives of patients with T1D with 0-1 antibody (n=21) and (2) high risk group: relatives with > 2 antibodies (n=19). Main Outcome Measure: Acute insulin and C-peptide responses to intravenous glucose (IVGTT) and to arginine at hyperglycemia (AIRmax). Participants underwent two IVGTT and AIRmax procedures on different days. Results: AIRmax was reproducible, well tolerated and correlated to FPIR from IVGTT (r =0.779). The high risk group had greater impaired beta cell function compared to the low risk group, determined both by lower mean FPIR and a greater number of subjects below an established threshold for abnormal function [10 of 19 (52.6%) vs. 4 of 21 (19%)]. There was a heterogeneous AIRmax response in these subjects with low FPIR, ranging from 38 to 250 uU/ml. Conclusions: There is significant variation in insulin secretory reserve as assessed by AIRmax in family members with low beta cell function assessed by FPIR. As AIRmax is a functional measure of beta cell mass, these data suggest heterogeneity in disease pathogenesis in which mass is preserved in relation to function in some individuals.

10.1001/jama.2017.13994.","Importance: Insulin pump therapy may improve metabolic control in young patients with type 1 diabetes, but the association with short-term diabetes complications is unclear. Objective: To determine whether rates of severe hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis are lower with insulin pump therapy compared with insulin injection therapy in children, adolescents, and young adults with type 1 diabetes. Design, Setting, and Participants: Population-based cohort study conducted between January 2011 and December 2015 in 446 diabetes centers participating in the Diabetes Prospective Follow-up Initiative in Germany, Austria, and Luxembourg. Patients with type 1 diabetes younger than 20 years and diabetes duration of more than 1 year were identified. Propensity score matching and inverse probability of treatment weighting analyses with age, sex, diabetes duration, migration background (defined as place of birth outside of Germany or Austria), body mass index, and glycated hemoglobin as covariates were used to account for relevant confounders. Exposures: Type 1 diabetes treated with insulin pump therapy or with multiple (>/=4) daily insulin injections. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes were rates of severe hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis during the most recent treatment year. Secondary outcomes included glycated hemoglobin levels, insulin dose, and body mass index. Results: Of 30579 patients (mean age, 14.1 years [SD, 4.0]; 53% male), 14119 used pump therapy (median duration, 3.7 years) and 16460 used insulin injections (median duration, 3.6 years). Patients using pump therapy (n = 9814) were matched with 9814 patients using injection therapy. Pump therapy, compared with injection therapy, was associated with lower rates of severe hypoglycemia (9.55 vs 13.97 per 100 patient-years; difference, -4.42 [95% CI, -6.15 to -2.69]; P < .001) and diabetic ketoacidosis (3.64 vs 4.26 per 100 patient-years; difference, -0.63 [95% CI, -1.24 to -0.02]; P = .04). Glycated hemoglobin levels were lower with pump therapy than with injection therapy (8.04% vs 8.22%; difference, -0.18 [95% CI, -0.22 to -0.13], P < .001). Total daily insulin doses were lower for pump therapy compared with injection therapy (0.84 U/kg vs 0.98 U/kg; difference, -0.14 [-0.15 to -0.13], P < .001). There was no significant difference in body mass index between both treatment regimens. Similar results were obtained after propensity score inverse probability of treatment weighting analyses in the entire cohort. Conclusions and Relevance: Among young patients with type 1 diabetes, insulin pump therapy, compared with insulin injection therapy, was associated with lower risks of severe hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis and with better glycemic control during the most recent year of therapy.

REVIEW: This review summarizes the current knowledge on the relationship of physical activity, exercise, and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) with cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) based on epidemiological, clinical, and interventional studies. RECENT FINDINGS: The prevalence of CAN increases with age and duration of diabetes. Further risk factors for CAN comprise poor glycemic control, dyslipidemia, abdominal obesity, hypertension, and the presence of diabetic complications. CAN has been also linked to reduced CRF. We recently showed that CRF parameters (e.g., maximal oxidative capacity or oxidative capacity at the anaerobic threshold) are associated with cardiac autonomic function in patients recently diagnosed with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Exercise interventions have shown that physical activity can increase cardiovagal activity and reduce sympathetic overactivity. In particular, long-term and regularly, but also supervised, performed endurance and high-intense and high-volume exercise improves cardiac autonomic function in patients with type 2 diabetes. By contrast, the evidence in those with type 1 diabetes and also in individuals with prediabetes or metabolic syndrome is weaker. Overall, the studies reviewed herein addressing the question whether favorably modulating the autonomic nervous system may improve CRF during exercise programs support the therapeutic concept to promote physical activity and to achieve physical fitness.

METHOD: A minimum of 2.5 days CGM was done on adolescents with T1DM during fasting in Ramadan and in the month before or after Ramadan to compare the differences in mean IG, and in the durations of hypoglycemia (<70mg/dL), hyperglycemia (200-299 mg/dL), and severe hyperglycemia (>/=300mg/dL) RESULTS: Fourteen adolescents were studied, age 15 +/- 4 years, duration of diabetes 6 +/- 4 years, and HbA1C 8.6 +/- 1.1% (70.3 mmol/mol). There was no difference in the mean IG (190 +/- 39 and 180 +/- 37, p= 0.4), or in the durations of hypoglycemia (5.14 +/- 5% and 7.03 +/- 4.9%, p=0.3), hyperglycemia (25.35 +/- 11.3% and 24.24 +/- 10.1% (P=0.7)), and severe hyperglycemia (13.21 +/- 13,4% and 10.96 +/- 10.6%, P=0.6), between Ramadan and, non-Ramadan, respectively CONCLUSION: Adolescents with T1DM have the same wide fluctuation in IG during fasting in Ramadan as they do outside Ramadan.

Acute-onset type 1 diabetes would be equivalent to type 1A diabetes, the typical type 1 diabetes in Western countries. The insulin secretion capacity in Japanese subjects with long-standing type 1A diabetes is unclear. The aim of this study is to clarify the course of endogenous insulin secretion during long-term follow-up and factors associated with residual insulin secretion in patients with acute-onset type 1 diabetes (autoimmune). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively investigated endogenous insulin secretion capacity in 71 patients who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for acute-onset type 1 diabetes (autoimmune) in Japan. To assess the residual insulin secretion capacity, we evaluated randomly measured C-peptide levels and results of glucagon stimulation test in 71 patients. RESULTS: In the first year of disease, the child- and adolescent-onset patients had significantly more in residual insulin secretion than the adult-onset patients (34 patients in total). C-peptide levels declined more rapidly in patients whose onset were younger than 18 years old have than in patients whose onset were older than 19 years old. Endogenous insulin secretion capacity stimulated by glucagon was completely lost in almost all patients at more than 15 years after onset (61 patients in total). CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with acute-onset type 1 diabetes (autoimmune) completely lose their endogenous insulin secretion capacity during the disease duration in Japan. Age of onset may affect the course of insulin secretion. This article is protected by copyright.

treatment satisfaction (TS) of subjects with LADA (latent autoimmune diabetes of the adult) and compare these measures with those of patients with other diabetes types, i.e., type 1 (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study with a total of 48 patients with LADA, 297 patients with T2DM and 124 with T1DM. The Audit of Diabetes-Dependent Quality of Life (ADDQoL-19) questionnaire and the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ) were administered. Relevant clinical variables were also assessed. The data analysis included comparisons between groups and multivariate linear models. RESULTS: The LADA patients presented lower diabetes-specific QoL (p = 0.045) and average weighted impact scores (p = 0.007) than the T2DM patients. The subgroup of LADA patients with diabetic retinopathy (DR) who were treated with insulin had a lower ADDQoL average weighted impact score than the other diabetic groups. Although the overall measure of TS was not different between the LADA and T2DM (p = 0.389) and T1DM (p = 0.091) groups, the patients with LADA showed a poorer hyperglycemic frequency perception than the T2DM patients (p < 0.001) and an improved frequency of hypoglycemic perception compared with the T1DM patients (p = 0.021). CONCLUSIONS: The current findings suggest a poorer quality of life, especially in terms of DR and insulin treatment, among patients with LADA compared with those with T1DM and T2DM. Hyperglycemia frequency perception was also poorer in the LADA patients than in the T1DM and T2DM patients.

Mobile health (mHealth) apps show promise in supporting self-management of chronic conditions such as type 1 diabetes. Many health care providers become involved in app development. Unfortunately, limited information is available to guide their selection of appropriate methods, techniques, and tools for a participatory design (PD) project in health care. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to develop an mHealth app to support young people in self-managing type 1 diabetes. This paper presents our methodological recommendations based on experiences and reflections from a 2-year research study. METHODS: A mixed methods design was used to identify user needs before designing the app and testing it in a randomized controlled trial. App design was based on qualitative, explorative, interventional, and experimental activities within an overall iterative PD approach. Several techniques and tools were used, including workshops, a mail panel, think-aloud tests, and a feasibility study. RESULTS: The final mHealth solution was \"Young with Diabetes\" (YWD). The iterative PD approach supported researchers and designers in understanding the needs of end users (ie, young people, parents, and health care providers) and their assessment of YWD, as well as how to improve app usability and feasibility. It is critical to include all end user groups during all phases of a PD project and to establish a multidisciplinary team to provide the wide range of expertise required to build a usable and useful mHealth app. CONCLUSIONS: Future research is needed to develop and evaluate more efficient PD techniques. Health care providers need guidance on what tools and techniques to choose for which subgroups of users and guidance on how to introduce an app to colleagues to successfully implement an mHealth app in health care organizations.

dyslipidemia and hypertension) and chronic microvascular and macrovascular complications among people with diabetes presenting to the tertiary-care academic diabetes outpatient clinics in Iran. This study is the prospective analysis of data (n = 30,202) from the registry of university-affiliated adult outpatient diabetes clinics in the country during 2015-2016. The proportions of type 1 diabetes, types 2 diabetes, and other types of diabetes were 11.4%, 85.5%, and 1.3%, respectively. The frequencies of drug-naivety, use of oral agents, insulin monotherapy and insulin combination therapy were 2.9%, 60.5%, 11.5%, and 25.1%, respectively. Around 13.2%, 11.9% and 43.3% of patients with diabetes had controlled hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia and hypertension, respectively. The proportions of retinopathy, nephropathy, peripheral neuropathy, diabetic foot, and ischemic heart disease were 21.9%, 17.6%, 28.0%, 6.2%, and 23.9%, respectively. Despite the wide availability of medications and insulin coverage in Iran, the estimated national control of hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia and hypertension (especially for young men and old women) remains subpar.

development that \"programs\" the immune system during early life as well. Factors influencing pathogenesis, including a leaky intestinal mucosal barrier, an aberrant gut microbiota composition, and altered immune responsiveness, offer potential targets for prevention and/or treatment of T1D through nutritional or pharmacologic means. In this review, nutritional approaches during early life in order to protect against T1D development have been discussed. The critical role of tolerogenic dendritic cells in central and peripheral tolerance has been emphasized. In addition, since the gut microbiota affects the development of T1D through short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-dependent mechanisms, we hypothesize that nutritional intervention boosting SCFA production may be used as a novel prevention strategy. Current retrospective evidence has suggested that exclusive and prolonged breastfeeding might play a protective role against the development of T1D. The beneficial properties of human milk are possibly attributed to its bioactive components such as unique immune-modulatory components human milk oligosaccharides and metabolites derived thereof, including SCFAs. These components might play a key role in healthy immune development and creating a fit and resilient immune system in early and later life.","type+1+diabetes",["Type","1","diabetes","(T1D)","is","an","immune-mediated","disease","with","a","strong","genetic","basis","but","might","be","influenced","by","non-genetic","factors","such","as","microbiome","development","that","\"programs\"","the","immune","system","during","early","life","as","well.","Factors","influencing","pathogenesis,","including","a","leaky","intestinal","mucosal","barrier,","an","aberrant","gut","microbiota","composition,","and","altered","immune","responsiveness,","offer","potential","targets","for","prevention","and/or","treatment","of","T1D","through","nutritional","or","pharmacologic","means.","In","this","review,","nutritional","approaches","during","early","life","in","order","to","protect","against","T1D","development","have","been","discussed.","The","critical","role","of","tolerogenic","dendritic","cells","in","central","and","peripheral","tolerance","has","been","emphasized.","In","addition,","since","the","gut","microbiota","affects","the","development","of","T1D","through","short-chain","fatty","acid","(SCFA)-dependent","mechanisms,","we","hypothesize","that","nutritional","intervention","boosting","SCFA","production","may","be","used","as","a","novel","prevention","strategy.","Current","retrospective","evidence","has","suggested","that","exclusive","and","prolonged","breastfeeding","might","play","a","protective","role","against","the","development","of","T1D.","The","beneficial","properties","of","human","milk","are","possibly","attributed","to","its","bioactive","components","such","as","unique","immune-modulatory","components","human","milk","oligosaccharides","and","metabolites","derived","thereof,","including","SCFAs.","These","components","might","play","a","key","role","in","healthy","immune","development","and","creating","a","fit","and","resilient","immune","system","in","early","and","later","life."],["Type","1","diabetes","(T1D)","immune-mediated","disease","strong","genetic","basis","might","influenced","non-genetic","factors","microbiome","development","\"programs\"","immune","system","early","life","well.","Factors","influencing","pathogenesis,","including","leaky","intestinal","mucosal","barrier,","aberrant","gut","microbiota","composition,","altered","immune","responsiveness,","offer","potential","targets","prevention","and/or","treatment","T1D","nutritional","pharmacologic","means.","review,","nutritional","approaches","early","life","order","protect","T1D","development","discussed.","critical","role","tolerogenic","dendritic","cells","central","peripheral","tolerance","emphasized.","addition,","since","gut","microbiota","affects","development","T1D","short-chain","fatty","acid","(SCFA)-dependent","mechanisms,","hypothesize","nutritional","intervention","boosting","SCFA","production","may","used","novel","prevention","strategy.","Current","retrospective","evidence","suggested","exclusive","prolonged","breastfeeding","might","play","protective","role","development","T1D.","beneficial","properties","human","milk","possibly","attributed","bioactive","components","unique","immune-modulatory","components","human","milk","oligosaccharides","metabolites","derived","thereof,","including","SCFAs.","components","might","play","key","role","healthy","immune","development","creating","fit","resilient","immune","system","early","later","life."],[0,300,[7,10,12,15,18,20,23,27,30,36,38,39,41,49,50,54,55,56,58,65,66,73,77,85,96,100,104,114,120,122,126,136,137,139,144,149,156,158,162,165,166,168,169,170,172,173,175,178,181,186,190,199,205,206,209,211,212,218,219,220,224,226,232,234,237,239,240,243,254,255,260,262,263,265,266,267,268,272,273,274,275,277,278,284,285,290,291,295],[2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,1.0]],[0,300,[7,10,12,15,18,20,23,27,30,36,38,39,41,49,50,54,55,56,58,65,66,73,77,85,96,100,104,114,120,122,126,136,137,139,144,149,156,158,162,165,166,168,169,170,172,173,175,178,181,186,190,199,205,206,209,211,212,218,219,220,224,226,232,234,237,239,240,243,254,255,260,262,263,265,266,267,268,272,273,274,275,277,278,284,285,290,291,295],[3.3821677293257353,0.9627748498890563,1.1656416591140484,1.6034755360643291,1.229293833954521,1.0154719451674472,1.6181451414000296,1.439315097437299,2.458587667909042,1.1536222836482644,1.440906187669541,0.8034198542151494,1.0711012599602607,1.1431203801211496,4.587110835158135,1.3912065191172684,0.8289966960047991,4.754992312826156,1.4204168972170694,1.4080136374336496,1.1926040767191763,1.0733039040226031,4.160014091855631,0.9908047129656508,2.1422025199205215,1.0375664788736902,1.0967294035326587,3.6380400998755964,0.9877636563898717,2.622327622887464,1.1393871678263923,3.2339326246867848,1.34097439363093

deteriorates during adolescence and the transition to young adulthood for patients with type 1 diabetes. The inability to manage type 1 diabetes effectively during these years is associated with poor glycemic control and complications from diabetes in adult life. Objective: To determine the effect of daily financial incentives on glucose monitoring adherence and glycemic control in adolescents and young adults with type 1 diabetes. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Behavioral Economic Incentives to Improve Glycemic Control Among Adolescents and Young Adults With Type 1 Diabetes (BE IN CONTROL) study was an investigator-blinded, 6-month, 2-arm randomized clinical trial conducted between January 22 and November 2, 2016, with 3-month intervention and follow-up periods. Ninety participants (aged 14-20) with suboptimally controlled type 1 diabetes (hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] >8.0%) were recruited from the Diabetes Center for Children at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Interventions: All participants were given daily blood glucose monitoring goals of 4 or more checks per day with 1 or more level within the goal range (70-180 mg/dL) collected with a wireless glucometer. The 3-month intervention consisted of a $60 monthly incentive in a virtual account, from which $2 was subtracted for every day of nonadherence to the monitoring goals. During a 3-month follow-up period, the intervention was discontinued. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was change in HbA1c levels at 3 months. Secondary outcomes included adherence to glucose monitoring and change in HbA1c levels at 6 months. All analyses were by intention to treat. Results: Of the 181 participants screened, 90 (52 [57.8%] girls) were randomized to the intervention (n = 45) or control (n = 45) arms. The mean (SD) age was 16.3 (1.9) years. The intervention group had significantly greater adherence to glucose monitoring goals in the incentive period (50.0% vs 18.9%; adjusted difference, 27.2%; 95% CI, 9.5% to 45.0%; P = .003) but not in the follow-up period (15.3% vs 8.7%; adjusted difference, 3.9%; 95% CI, -2.0% to 9.9%; P = .20). The change in HbA1c levels from baseline did not differ significantly between groups at 3 months (adjusted difference, -0.08%; 95% CI, -0.69% to 0.54%; P = .80) or 6 months (adjusted difference, 0.03%; 95% CI, -0.55% to 0.60%; P = .93). Conclusions and Relevance: Among adolescents and young adults with type 1 diabetes, daily financial incentives improved glucose monitoring adherence during the incentive period but did not significantly improve glycemic control.

Endocrinol Metab. 2017 Oct 9. doi: 10.1210/jc.2017-00781.","Context: Children with type 1 diabetes have vascular dysfunction preceding atherosclerosis. Early interventions are needed to reduce cardiovascular disease. Objective: To evaluate the effect of metformin on vascular function in type 1 diabetes children. Design: 12 month double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Setting: Tertiary pediatric diabetes clinic. Participants: 90 type 1 diabetes children(8-18 years), above 50th percentile body mass index (BMI). Intervention: Metformin (up to 1g twice a day) or placebo. Main outcome measure: Vascular function measured by brachial artery ultrasound (flow mediated dilatation [FMD]/glyceryl trinitrate mediated dilatation[GTN]). Results: 90 enrolled [41 boys, 13.6(2.5) years, 45/group],10 discontinued intervention, 1 lost to follow up. On metformin, GTN improved, independent of HbA1c, by 3.3 percentage units (95%CI 0.3, 6.3, p=0.03) and insulin dose reduced by 0.2units/kg/day (95%CI 0.1,0.3, p=0.001) over 12 months, with effects from 3 months. Metformin had a beneficial effect on HbA1c at 3 months, (p=0.001) and difference in adjusted HbA1c between groups over 12 months was 1.0%;95%CI 0.4,1.5 (10.9mmol/mol;95%CI 4.4,16.4) p=0.001. There were no effects on carotid/aortic intima media thickness, BMI, lipids, blood pressure or other cardiovascular risk factors. Median (95%CI) adherence, evaluated by electronic monitoring, was 75.5%(65.7, 81.5), without group differences. More gastrointestinal side effects were reported on metformin (Incidence Rate Ratio 1.65, 95%CI 1.08, 2.52, p=0.02), with no difference in hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis. Conclusions: Metformin improved vascular smooth muscle function and HbA1c, and lowered insulin dose in type 1 diabetes children.

insulin therapy in patients with type 1 diabetes. METHODS: We included clinical studies comparing pramlintide plus insulin to placebo plus insulin. Efficacy was reflected by glycemic control and reduction in body weight and insulin use. Safety concerns were hypoglycemia and other adverse events. Subgroup analysis was performed for different doses (30, 60, 90 microg/meal) and durations (</=4, 26, 29, >29 weeks) of the treatment. RESULTS: A total of 10 randomized placebo-controlled studies were included for this meta-analysis (pramlintide, n=1978; placebo, n=1319). Compared with controls, patients given pramlintide had significantly lower HbA1c (p < 0.001), total daily insulin dose (p = 0.024), mean mealtime insulin dose (p < 0.001), body weight (p < 0.001) and postprandial glucose level (p = 0.002). The addition of pramlintide increased the incidence of nausea (p < 0.001), vomiting (p < 0.001), anorexia (p < 0.001) and hypoglycemia (p < 0.05) at the initiation of the treatment. The efficacy and adverse reactions of pramlintide were largely significant for the different doses and durations of the treatment.

review seeks to characterize emerging concepts related to disease-modifying therapy in type 1 diabetes. RECENT FINDINGS: We begin by describing the new understanding that islet autoimmunity, as identified by the presence of islet autoantibodies, inevitably leads to clinical type 1 diabetes. This understanding informs the new staging paradigm for type 1 diabetes, which suggests that type 1 diabetes may be recognized and diagnosed long before symptoms develop. Although it is known that nearly all individuals with established islet autoimmunity will eventually develop symptomatic type 1 diabetes (T1D), individual characteristics such as age and biomarker profile may predict rate of disease progression and response to treatment and may therefore be used to individualize therapy. Key research supports the use of immunotherapy in TID, although a paradigm shift is necessary before immunotherapy may transition from clinical trials to clinical practice. Recent and ongoing research as it relates to these concepts is described throughout.","type+1+diabetes",["PURPOSE","OF","REVIEW:","This","review","seeks","to","characterize","emerging","concepts","related","to","disease-modifying","therapy","in","type","1","diabetes.","RECENT","FINDINGS:","We","begin","by","describing","the","new","understanding","that","islet","autoimmunity,","as","identified","by","the","presence","of","islet","autoantibodies,","inevitably","leads","to","clinical","type","1","diabetes.","This","understanding","informs","the","new","staging","paradigm","for","type","1","diabetes,","which","suggests","that","type","1","diabetes","may","be","recognized","and","diagnosed","long","before","symptoms","develop.","Although","it","is","known","that","nearly","all","individuals","with","established","islet","autoimmunity","will","eventually","develop","symptomatic","type","1","diabetes","(T1D),","individual","characteristics","such","as","age","and","biomarker","profile","may","predict","rate","of","disease","progression","and","response","to","treatment","and","may","therefore","be","used","to","individualize","therapy.","Key","research","supports","the","use","of","immunotherapy","in","TID,","although","a","paradigm","shift","is","necessary","before","immunotherapy","may","transition","from","clinical","trials","to","clinical","practice.","Recent","and","ongoing","research","as","it","relates","to","these","concepts","is","described","throughout."],["PURPOSE","REVIEW:","review","seeks","characterize","emerging","concepts","related","disease-modifying","therapy","type","1","diabetes.","RECENT","FINDINGS:","begin","describing","new","understanding","islet","autoimmunity,","identified","presence","islet","autoantibodies,","inevitably","leads","clinical","type","1","diabetes.","understanding","informs","new","staging","paradigm","type","1","diabetes,","suggests","type","1","diabetes","may","recognized","diagnosed","long","symptoms","develop.","Although","known","nearly","individuals","established","islet","autoimmunity","eventually","develop","symptomatic","type","1","diabetes","(T1D),","individual","characteristics","age","biomarker","profile","may","predict","rate","disease","progression","response","treatment","may","therefore","used","individualize","therapy.","Key","research","supports","use","immunotherapy","TID,","although","paradigm","shift","necessary","immunotherapy","may","transition","clinical","trials","clinical","practice.","Recent","ongoing","research","relates","concepts","described","throughout."],[0,300,[3,12,20,24,25,26,39,41,45,53,55,58,67,69,71,72,73,75,77,80,88,91,94,95,98,100,104,115,116,119,123,129,133,134,136,139,144,146,148,150,152,154,156,166,169,175,190,191,197,199,205,210,214,218,223,232,233,234,244,263,264,265,272,274,276,279,289,292,294,299],[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]],[0,300,[3,12,20,24,25,26,39,41,45,53,55,58,67,69,71,72,73,75,77,80,88,91,94,95,98,100,104,115,116,119,123,129,133,134,136,139,144,146,148,150,152,154,156,166,169,175,190,191,197,199,205,210,214,218,223,232,233,234,244,263,264,265,272,274,276,279,289,292,294,299],[1.2687207539339787,2.3312833182280968,1.0154719451674472,0.4963561184809827,1.8291919515915835,4.429251855779065,3.2136794168605975,2.1422025199205215,1.1729232446853115,0.8931898536438588,0.8289966960047991,1.4204168972170694,2.324041306694192,1.3083705135381192,1.1288422546497774,0.9024406134160099,1.0733039040226031,0.9958937824731221,1.386671363951877,1.4650814182015282,2.516107972259567,0.7071918221205956,1.3453065303700698,0.8118729899262077,0.7087220443013633,3.112699436621071,1.0967294035326587,2.1844497828231084,3.0975368738022695,1.456957896680049,1.33809669380332,0.8561318400979634,1.4313973997005138,1.014431903472033,0.8084831561716962,0.8490584242222367,3.415107305963913,2.0371971523337584,1.1524282536556567,1.4553410814531436,1.3988111185024876,1.5343073627579418,2.518762252675692,3.160166913075893,1.505020170486153,0.7226004474734408,1.4126468503551377,1.1632261990024446,1.2076231325028917,1.3238311166444976,0.8034198542151494,1.162020653347096,1.349657516204396,0.9174221670316269,1.2038471682933567,2.3337031612335233,1.195091640190978,3.6532879090659933,1.1126569302287599,1.9157023140545433,0.7719342376415829,0.9509984625652311,0.9278537457414425,2.4152462650057833,2.5081662014005817,2.5590050590745346,0.7719342376415829,1.1092224677801252,0.5649068055698382,0.7390391738166007]],1.0],["Environmental Factors Contribute to beta Cell Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress and Neo-Antigen Formation in Type 1 Diabetes.",["Marre ML","Piganelli JD"],"Front Endocrinol (Lausanne). 2017 Sep 29;8:262. doi: 10.3389/fendo.2017.00262. eCollection 2017.","Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease in which immune-mediated targeting and destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic islet beta cells leads to chronic hyperglycemia. There are many beta cell proteins that are targeted by autoreactive T cells in their native state. However, recent studies have demonstrated that many beta cell proteins are recognized as neo-antigens following posttranslational modification (PTM). Although modified neo-antigens are well-established targets of pathology in other autoimmune diseases, the effects of neo-antigens in T1D progression and the mechanisms by which they are generated are not well understood. We have demonstrated that PTM occurs during endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, a process to which beta cells are uniquely susceptible due to the high rate of insulin production in response to dynamic glucose sensing. In the context of genetic susceptibility to autoimmunity, presentation of these modified neo-antigens may activate autoreactive T cells and cause pathology. However, inherent beta cell ER stress and protein PTM do not cause T1D in every genetically susceptible individual, suggesting the contribution of additional factors. Indeed, many environmental factors, such as viral infection, chemicals, or inflammatory cytokines, are associated with T1D onset, but the mechanisms by which these factors lead to disease onset remain unknown. Since these environmental factors also cause ER stress, exposure to these factors may enhance production of neo-antigens, therefore boosting beta cell recognition by autoreactive T cells and exacerbating T1D pathogenesis. Therefore, the combined effects of physiological ER stress and the stress that is induced by environmental factors may lead to breaks in peripheral tolerance, contribute to antigen spread, and hasten disease onset.

not known when this defect develops. The current study set out to determine whether the reduced exocrine function becomes manifest after the initiation of islet autoimmunity. METHODS: The study was nested in the prospective Type 1 Diabetes Prediction and Prevention study where children with human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-conferred susceptibility are observed from birth. Elastase-1 levels were analyzed from stool samples collected at the time of seroconversion to islet autoantibody positivity and at diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, as well as from samples taken from matched control children of similar age. RESULTS: Elastase levels were lower in case children at the time of the diagnosis of diabetes when compared to the control children. However, elastase concentrations did not differ between cases and controls at the time when autoantibodies appeared. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the defect in the exocrine function develops after the appearance of islet autoantibodies. Further studies are needed to assess whether reduced elastase levels predict rapid progression of islet autoimmunity to clinical disease.","type+1+diabetes",["OBJECTIVE:","The","function","of","the","exocrine","pancreas","is","decreased","in","patients","with","type","1","diabetes","but","it","is","not","known","when","this","defect","develops.","The","current","study","set","out","to","determine","whether","the","reduced","exocrine","function","becomes","manifest","after","the","initiation","of","islet","autoimmunity.","METHODS:","The","study","was","nested","in","the","prospective","Type","1","Diabetes","Prediction","and","Prevention","study","where","children","with","human","leukocyte","antigen","(HLA)-conferred","susceptibility","are","observed","from","birth.","Elastase-1","levels","were","analyzed","from","stool","samples","collected","at","the","time","of","seroconversion","to","islet","autoantibody","positivity","and","at","diagnosis","of","type","1","diabetes,","as","well","as","from","samples","taken","from","matched","control","children","of","similar","age.","RESULTS:","Elastase","levels","were","lower","in","case","children","at","the","time","of","the","diagnosis","of","diabetes","when","compared","to","the","control","children.","However,","elastase","concentrations","did","not","differ","between","cases","and","controls","at","the","time","when","autoantibodies","appeared.","CONCLUSION:","The","results","suggest","that","the","defect","in","the","exocrine","function","develops","after","the","appearance","of","islet","autoantibodies.","Further","studies","are","needed","to","assess","whether","reduced","elastase","levels","predict","rapid","progression","of","islet","autoimmunity","to","clinical","disease."],["OBJECTIVE:","function","exocrine","pancreas","decreased","patients","type","1","diabetes","known","defect","develops.","current","study","set","determine","whether","reduced","exocrine","function","becomes","manifest","initiation","islet","autoimmunity.","METHODS:","study","nested","prospective","Type","1","Diabetes","Prediction","Prevention","study","children","human","leukocyte","antigen","(HLA)-conferred","susceptibility","observed","birth.","Elastase-1","levels","analyzed","stool","samples","collected","time","seroconversion","islet","autoantibody","positivity","diagnosis","type","1","diabetes,","well","samples","taken","matched","control","children","similar","age.","RESULTS:","Elastase","levels","lower","case","children","time","diagnosis","diabetes","compared","control","children.","However,","elastase","concentrations","differ","cases","controls","time","autoantibodies","appeared.","CONCLUSION:","results","suggest","defect","exocrine","function","develops","appearance","islet","autoantibodies.","studies","needed","assess","whether","reduced","elastase","levels","predict","rapid","progression","islet","autoimmunity","clinical","disease."],[0,300,[0,13,20,23,24,26,32,39,42,46,49,50,53,55,58,62,63,64,69,72,73,75,86,99,100,110,115,116,129,134,137,144,149,157,161,162,174,179,180,192,195,196,201,206,207,211,213,214,220,221,223,229,233,236,244,245,247,248,249,252,256,257,262,268,272,273,276,288,291,293,294],[1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0]],[0,300,[0,13,20,23,24,26,32,39,42,46,49,50,53,55,58,62,63,64,69,72,73,75,86,99,100,110,115,116,129,134,137,144,149,157,161,162,174,179,180,192,195,196,201,206,207,211,213,214,220,221,223,229,233,236,244,245,247,248,249,252,256,257,262,268,272,273,276,288,291,293,294],[1.229293833954521,0.9827156900925671,3.0464158355023416,1.6181451414000296,0.4963561184809827,1.7717007423116262,1.1988346264698124,1.6068397084302988,0.8464187394514634,0.9374323630385122,1.7146805701817245,0.9174221670316269,0.8931898536438588,0.8289966960047991,1.4204168972170694,1.2472534875491068,0.8803808953512776,0.8333238338686806,1.3083705135381192,1.8048812268320198,1.0733039040226031,1.9917875649462442,1.3195908276056123,0.7311774981052004,4.150265915494761,2.0836617553202954,1.0922248914115542,0.7743842184505674,0.8561318400979634,1.014431903472033,1.340974393630935,2.0490643835783477,1.032261426643997,0.9897899995351042,3.6494686851255986,1.219037333787332,2.2460633261086236,1.7719790146350614,1.6729165546259006,0.6427966598822736,1.5360571444817295,1.6614506098108337,1.0259322915923494,1.3424163549478365,2.5726013045021765,0.8411601821979965,3.033954758396261,2.699315032408792,2.8267688972080953,1.325248551325471,1.2038471682933567,2.9897698971842197,1.195091640190978,1.08327628583554,1.1126569302287599,1.8179348862253888,1.3927228196352324,0.8950331721381481,0.9897899995351042,0.9989597020949569,2.481919105540967,3.7728955400724042,1.4345569599908823,2.045565365378906,1.855707491482885,1.0113182527987536,2.5081662014005817,3.2431547724402865,2.8037384497226174,1.9573911683518028,0.5649068055698382]],1.0],["Gain-of-function

animal models of renal injury, limited studies in humans are available, and its participation in diabetic kidney disease (DKD) remains unknown. Aim of this study was to elucidate the contribution of inflammasome genetics in the development of DKD in type-1 diabetes (T1D). The association of functional variants in inflammasome genes with DKD was assessed by multivariate analysis in a retrospective and in a prospective cohort. NLRP1 rs2670660 and rs11651270 polymorphisms were significantly associated with a decrease risk to develop DKD (padj<0.01), and rs11651270 also with a lower risk of new renal events during follow-up (padj=0.01). Supporting these findings, diabetes metabolites (glycated albumin and high glucose) were able to modulate NLRP1 expression. This study is the first to suggest a protective role of NLRP1 in DKD, highlighting an emerging role of NLRP1 as a homeostatic factor against metabolic stress.","type+1+diabetes",["Although","inflammasome","plays","a","well-known","role","in","animal","models","of","renal","injury,","limited","studies","in","humans","are","available,","and","its","participation","in","diabetic","kidney","disease","(DKD)","remains","unknown.","Aim","of","this","study","was","to","elucidate","the","contribution","of","inflammasome","genetics","in","the","development","of","DKD","in","type-1","diabetes","(T1D).","The","association","of","functional","variants","in","inflammasome","genes","with","DKD","was","assessed","by","multivariate","analysis","in","a","retrospective","and","in","a","prospective","cohort.","NLRP1","rs2670660","and","rs11651270","polymorphisms","were","significantly","associated","with","a","decrease","risk","to","develop","DKD","(padj<0.01),","and","rs11651270","also","with","a","lower","risk","of","new","renal","events","during","follow-up","(padj=0.01).","Supporting","these","findings,","diabetes","metabolites","(glycated","albumin","and","high","glucose)","were","able","to","modulate","NLRP1","expression.","This","study","is","the","first","to","suggest","a","protective","role","of","NLRP1","in","DKD,","highlighting","an","emerging","role","of","NLRP1","as","a","homeostatic","factor","against","metabolic","stress."],["Although","inflammasome","plays","well-known","role","animal","models","renal","injury,","limited","studies","humans","available,","participation","diabetic","kidney","disease","(DKD)","remains","unknown.","Aim","study","elucidate","contribution","inflammasome","genetics","development","DKD","type-1","diabetes","(T1D).","association","functional","variants","inflammasome","genes","DKD","assessed","multivariate","analysis","retrospective","prospective","cohort.","NLRP1","rs2670660","rs11651270","polymorphisms","significantly","associated","decrease","risk","develop","DKD","(padj<0.01),","rs11651270","also","lower","risk","new","renal","events","follow-up","(padj=0.01).","Supporting","findings,","diabetes","metabolites","(glycated","albumin","high","glucose)","able","modulate","NLRP1","expression.","study","first","suggest","protective","role","NLRP1","DKD,","highlighting","emerging","role","NLRP1","homeostatic","factor","metabolic","stress."],[0,300,[4,15,19,20,25,32,39,42,45,48,49,50,53,55,56,58,60,62,63,64,71,75,77,82,83,90,91,95,96,99,112,114,139,145,150,156,157,162,170,172,175,183,185,186,188,192,194,196,208,211,216,218,222,238,240,243,247,248,249,252,253,274,285,288,293,294,296],[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0]],[0,300,[4,15,19,20,25,32,39,42,45,48,49,50,53,55,56,58,60,62,63,64,71,75,77,82,83,90,91,95,96,99,112,114,139,145,150,156,157,162,170,172,175,183,185,186,188,192,194,196,208,211,216,218,222,238,240,243,247,248,249,252,253,274,285,288,293,294,296],[2.8346032598002404,0.8017377680321646,1.597448259628875,1.0154719451674472,1.8291919515915835,1.1988346264698124,1.6068397084302988,0.8464187394514634,2.345846489370623,4.2932156160904125,1.7146805701817245,3.6696886681265077,2.6795695609315766,0.8289966960047991,0.9509984625652311,1.4204168972170694,1.0428998248490526,0.6236267437745534,0.8803808953512776,0.8333238338686806,1.1288422546497774,0.9958937824731221,1.386671363951877,3.8835596298126607,1.9157023140545433,1.0040905496773007,0.7071918221205956,0.8118729899262077,3.213303779880782,0.7311774981052004,1.4034017922110866,2.425360066583731,0.8490584242222367,1.5808273783928346,1.4553410814531436,1.259381126337846,0.9897899995351042,1.219037333787332,1.452115272204261,0.8722323667873726,0.7226004474734408,1.5808273783928346,1.3280894623270747,1.34386039852007,1.3352272513753671,0.6427966598822736,1.1149531424891101,0.8307253049054169,1.078831834075116,0.8411601821979965,0.9807036169791469,0.9174221670316269,2.302471295341067,1.229293833954521,1.158412711970897,2.0205650398504433,1.3927228196352324,0.8950331721381481,0.9897899995351042,0.9989597020949569,1.1839460139760616,1.2076231325028917,1.0165130696758577,1.0810515908134288,0.9786955841759014,1.1298136111396764,1.309766187177094]],1.0],["High Glucose Variability in Hospitalized Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus.",["Dadlani V","Tamhane SU","Sun A","Sharma A","Delivanis DA","Thapa P","Carter RE","Kudva YC"],"Diabetes Technol Ther. 2017 Oct;19(10):572-579. doi: 10.1089/dia.2017.0107.","BACKGROUND: Glucose variability (GV) has been increasingly (or more extensively) studied in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) in the ambulatory setting; limited data exist on GV in hospitalized patients with T1D. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective single center cohort study, we analyzed in-hospital glucose measurements to assess GV in 736 hospitalized patients in different units over a consecutive 5-year period of time. GV was assessed by mean blood glucose (BG), Average daily risk range (ADRR), high BG index, and low BG index. To place our findings in context, we conducted a systematic review using Cochrane collaboration methodology to critically analyze current published literature on GV in hospitalized T1D patients. RESULTS: Overall, glycemic control was suboptimal with mean BG 183 +/- 51.5 mg/dL and mean ADRR 35 with only 16% patients being categorized as low risk (ADRR <20) for hypo or hyperglycemia. Patients admitted in medical units had mean BG of 194.4 +/- 42.8 mg/dL (95% CI = 101.2-346.6) and ADRR of 39.4 +/- 16 (95% CI = 1.3-118.7), which were higher than the patients admitted in the surgical units (mean BG 168.1 +/- 35.7 (95% CI = 74.8-301.8) and mean ADRR (28.8 +/- 13.1 [95% CI = 0.3-93.1]). For the systematic review, initial search yielded 2336 studies for screening, however, none of them had data specific for T1D. CONCLUSION: GV is high in hospitalized T1D patients admitted at our tertiary care center. Review of the literature shows paucity of data regarding GV in hospitalized patients with T1D.","type+1+diabetes",["BACKGROUND:","Glucose","variability","(GV)","has","been","increasingly","(or","more","extensively)","studied","in","patients","with","type","1","diabetes","(T1D)","in","the","ambulatory","setting;","limited","data","exist","on","GV","in","hospitalized","patients","with","T1D.","MATERIALS","AND","METHODS:","Retrospective","single","center","cohort","study,","we","analyzed","in-hospital","glucose","measurements","to","assess","GV","in","736","hospitalized","patients","in","different","units","over","a","consecutive","5-year","period","of","time.","GV","was","assessed","by","mean","blood","glucose","(BG),","Average","daily","risk","range","(ADRR),","high","BG","index,","and","low","BG","index.","To","place","our","findings","in","context,","we","conducted","a","systematic","review","using","Cochrane","collaboration","methodology","to","critically","analyze","current","published","literature","on","GV","in","hospitalized","T1D","patients.","RESULTS:","Overall,","glycemic","control","was","suboptimal","with","mean","BG","183","+/-","51.5","mg/dL","and","mean","ADRR","35","with","only","16%","patients","being","categorized","as","low","risk","(ADRR","<20)","for","hypo","or","hyperglycemia.","Patients","admitted","in","medical","units","had","mean","BG","of","194.4","+/-","42.8","mg/dL","(95%","CI","=","101.2-346.6)","and","ADRR","of","39.4","+/-","16","(95%","CI","=","1.3-118.7),","which","were","higher","than","the","patients","admitted","in","the","surgical","units","(mean","BG","168.1","+/-","35.7","(95%","CI","=","74.8-301.8)","and","mean","ADRR","(28.8","+/-","13.1","[95%","CI","=","0.3-93.1]).","For","the","systematic","review,","initial","search","yielded","2336","studies","for","screening,","however,","none","of","them","had","data","specific","for","T1D.","CONCLUSION:","GV","is","high","in","hospitalized","T1D","patients","admitted","at","our","tertiary","care","center.","Review","of","the","literature","shows","paucity","of","data","regarding","GV","in","hospitalized","patients","with","T1D."],["BACKGROUND:","Glucose","variability","(GV)","increasingly","(or","extensively)","studied","patients","type","1","diabetes","(T1D)","ambulatory","setting;","limited","data","exist","GV","hospitalized","patients","T1D.","MATERIALS","METHODS:","Retrospective","single","center","cohort","study,","analyzed","in-hospital","glucose","measurements","assess","GV","736","hospitalized","patients","different","units","consecutive","5-year","period","time.","GV","assessed","mean","blood","glucose","(BG),","Average","daily","risk","range","(ADRR),","high","BG","index,","low","BG","index.","place","findings","context,","conducted","systematic","review","using","Cochrane","collaboration","methodology","critically","analyze","current","published","literature","GV","hospitalized","T1D","patients.","RESULTS:","Overall,","glycemic","control","suboptimal","mean","BG","183","+/-","51.5","mg/dL","mean","ADRR","35","16%","patients","categorized","low","risk","(ADRR","<20)","hypo","hyperglycemia.","Patients","admitted","medical","units","mean","BG","194.4","+/-","42.8","mg/dL","(95%","CI","=","101.2-346.6)","ADRR","39.4","+/-","16","(95%","CI","=","1.3-118.7),","higher","patients","admitted","surgical","units","(mean","BG","168.1","+/-","35.7","(95%","CI","=","74.8-301.8)","mean","ADRR","(28.8","+/-","13.1","[95%","CI","=","0.3-93.1]).","systematic","review,","initial","search","yielded","2336","studies","screening,","however,","none","data","specific","T1D.","CONCLUSION:","GV","high","hospitalized","T1D","patients","admitted","tertiary","care","center.","Review","literature","shows","paucity","data","regarding","GV","hospitalized","patients","T1D."],[0,300,[1,3,15,24,26,28,29,30,31,33,37,39,41,42,45,46,48,50,52,56,59,62,63,64,70,79,81,82,84,86,92,99,103,105,109,110,111,113,116,117,118,119,126,130,132,133,134,136,138,141,144,145,146,149,150,155,160,161,162,164,167,168,172,173,174,176,180,187,189,190,196,197,201,203,210,211,212,216,219,231,238,243,244,246,248,250,263,264,266,267,268,269,273,274,278,280,284,286,288,289,290,291,294,295,297],[1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0]],[0,300,[1,3,15,24,26,28,29,30,31,33,37,39,41,42,45,46,48,50,52,56,59,62,63,64,70,79,81,82,84,86,92,99,103,105,109,110,111,113,116,117,118,119,126,130,132,133,134,136,138,141,144,145,146,149,150,155,160,161,162,164,167,168,172,173,174,176,180,187,189,190,196,197,201,203,210,211,212,216,219,231,238,243,244,246,248,250,263,264,266,267,268,269,273,274,278,280,284,286,288,289,290,291,294,295,297],[0.895956107136749,5.074883015735915,0.8017377680321646,0.99271223696196

Oxidative stress is the cause and consequence of numerous diseases including type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), in which there is selective destruction of insulin producing pancreatic beta-cells. Studies have documented that hyperglycemia produces profound stress. In vivo production of numerous reactive oxygen, nitrogen, chlorine species and lipid/sugar oxidation products are result of persistent hyperglycemia. Post-translational modifications by reactive species may create new antigenic epitopes and play a role in the development of autoimmune response. In this paper our main focus was to establish the effect of existing hyperglycemia induced oxido-nitrosative stress in T1DM patients on the integrity of human serum albumin. Raised nitric oxide, carbonyl, RBC hemolysis, lowered ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), thiol and deformed RBC in T1DM are all highly suggestive of persistent oxido-nitrosative stress. Hyperglycemia induced generation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) was established by LCMS. Chronic oxido-nitrosative stress can modify HSA in T1DM patients, producing immunologically active albumin. Therefore, it is speculated that the aberrant HSA may play a role in the initiation/progression of T1DM.","type+1+diabetes",["Chronic","oxidative","stress","fuels","pathogenesis","of","a","large","set","of","diseases.","Oxidative","stress","is","the","cause","and","consequence","of","numerous","diseases","including","type","1","diabetes","mellitus","(T1DM),","in","which","there","is","selective","destruction","of","insulin","producing","pancreatic","beta-cells.","Studies","have","documented","that","hyperglycemia","produces","profound","stress.","In","vivo","production","of","numerous","reactive","oxygen,","nitrogen,","chlorine","species","and","lipid/sugar","oxidation","products","are","result","of","persistent","hyperglycemia.","Post-translational","modifications","by","reactive","species","may","create","new","antigenic","epitopes","and","play","a","role","in","the","development","of","autoimmune","response.","In","this","paper","our","main","focus","was","to","establish","the","effect","of","existing","hyperglycemia","induced","oxido-nitrosative","stress","in","T1DM","patients","on","the","integrity","of","human","serum","albumin.","Raised","nitric","oxide,","carbonyl,","RBC","hemolysis,","lowered","ferric","reducing","antioxidant","power","(FRAP),","thiol","and","deformed","RBC","in","T1DM","are","all","highly","suggestive","of","persistent","oxido-nitrosative","stress.","Hyperglycemia","induced","generation","of","advanced","glycation","end","products","(AGEs)","was","established","by","LCMS.","Chronic","oxido-nitrosative","stress","can","modify","HSA","in","T1DM","patients,","producing","immunologically","active","albumin.","Therefore,","it","is","speculated","that","the","aberrant","HSA","may","play","a","role","in","the","initiation/progression","of","T1DM."],["Chronic","oxidative","stress","fuels","pathogenesis","large","set","diseases.","Oxidative","stress","cause","consequence","numerous","diseases","including","type","1","diabetes","mellitus","(T1DM),","selective","destruction","insulin","producing","pancreatic","beta-cells.","Studies","documented","hyperglycemia","produces","profound","stress.","vivo","production","numerous","reactive","oxygen,","nitrogen,","chlorine","species","lipid/sugar","oxidation","products","result","persistent","hyperglycemia.","Post-translational","modifications","reactive","species","may","create","new","antigenic","epitopes","play","role","development","autoimmune","response.","paper","main","focus","establish","effect","existing","hyperglycemia","induced","oxido-nitrosative","stress","T1DM","patients","integrity","human","serum","albumin.","Raised","nitric","oxide,","carbonyl,","RBC","hemolysis,","lowered","ferric","reducing","antioxidant","power","(FRAP),","thiol","deformed","RBC","T1DM","highly","suggestive","persistent","oxido-nitrosative","stress.","Hyperglycemia","induced","generation","advanced","glycation","end","products","(AGEs)","established","LCMS.","Chronic","oxido-nitrosative","stress","modify","HSA","T1DM","patients,","producing","immunologically","active","albumin.","Therefore,","speculated","aberrant","HSA","may","play","role","initiation/progression","T1DM."],[0,300,[1,2,3,9,13,18,21,25,26,27,34,37,39,41,45,50,54,55,56,59,61,62,70,71,73,76,82,83,84,88,93,96,97,98,99,106,108,109,117,118,120,123,128,137,141,144,145,148,149,160,161,164,166,168,170,171,172,173,184,190,196,197,199,203,204,206,215,219,220,225,230,237,241,242,246,248,254,258,262,265,268,275,279,286,290,291,295,297],[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]],[0,300,[1,2,3,9,13,18,21,25,26,27,34,37,39,41,45,50,54,55,56,59,61,62,70,71,73,76,82,83,84,88,93,96,97,98,99,106,108,109,117,118,120,123,128,137,141,144,145,148,149,160,161,164,166,168,170,171,172,173,184,190,196,197,199,203,204,206,215,219,220,225,230,237,241,242,246,248,254,258,262,265,268,275,279,286,290,291,295,297],[0.895956107136749,1.2152181057203364,1.2687207539339787,2.1598821930588032,0.9827156900925671,1.229293833954521,1.4080136374336496,0.9145959757957918,0.8858503711558131,1.439315097437299,2.9203987812084398,1.1851783000223266,0.8034198542151494,2.1422025199205215,3.5187697340559345,3.6696886681265077,1.3912065191172684,0.8289966960047991,1.9019969251304623,2.5320867523265247,1.4537268760986024,0.6236267437745534,1.0777238007207541,1.1288422546497774,1.0733039040226031,1.3337956119039294,3.8835596298126607,1.9157023140545433,1.380656308222116,1.2580539861297835,0.5682279643847652,1.0711012599602607,1.1913626116311113,0.7087220443013633,0.7311774981052004,1.5789975517157584,1.3687336632652098,2.0392859253695708,1.4881847560222903,1.0810515908134288,0.9877636563898717,2.67619338760664,2.684832709895673,1.340974393630935,1.4204168972170694,0.6830214611927826,4.742482135178504,1.1524282536556567,3.096784279931991,2.

Diabetes. 2017 Oct 23. doi: 10.1111/pedi.12595.","BACKGROUND: Vitamin D (VitD) deficiency is prevalent in adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and is associated with diabetes-related vascular complications in adulthood. The objective of this clinical trial was to assess VitD treatment on endothelial function (EF) and markers of renal inflammation, in this patient group. METHODS: Adolescents with T1D with suboptimal levels of VitD (<37.5 nmol/L) were treated for 12 to 24 weeks with a VitD analog (VitD3 ) at doses of 1000 or 2000 IU daily. The primary end-point assessed the change in reactive hyperemia index (lnRHI), a measure of EF. Secondary end-points included changes in blood pressure, lipid profile, HbA1c and albumin creatinine ratio (ACR). Urinary cytokine/chemokine inflammatory profile was also assessed in a subset of subjects posttreatment. RESULTS: Two hundred and seventy-one subjects were screened for VitD status and 31 VitD deficient subjects with a mean age of 15.7 +/- 1.4 years were enrolled and completed the study. Mean 25-OH-VitD levels significantly increased (33.0 +/- 12.8 vs 67.0 +/- 23.2 nmol/L, P < .01) with a significant improvement in EF following VitD supplementation (lnRHI 0.58 +/- 0.20 vs 0.68 +/- 0.21, P = .03). VitD supplementation did not significantly impact systolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP), lipids, HbA1c and ACR and no adverse effects were seen. Several urinary inflammatory cytokines/chemokines: MCP-3 (P < .01), epidermal growth factor (EGF) (P < .01) tumor necrosis factor beta (TNFbeta) (P = .01), interleukin-10 (IL-10) (P = .01), also significantly decreased post-VitD-treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with VitD was associated with an improvement in EF and reduced expression of urinary inflammatory markers in adolescents with T1D.

Soc. 2017 Jul;2017:2765-2768. doi: 10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037430.","This study aims at demonstrating the need for nonlinear recursive models to the identification and prediction of the dynamic glucose system in type 1 diabetes. Nonlinear regression is performed in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, by the Approximate Linear Dependency Kernel Recursive Least Squares (KRLS-ALD) algorithm, such that a sparse model structure is accomplished. The method is evaluated on seven people with type 1 diabetes in free-living conditions, where a change in glycaemic dynamics is forced by increasing the level of physical activity in the middle of the observational period. The univariate input allows for short-term (</=30 min) predictions with KRLS-ALD reaching an average root mean square error of 15.22+/-5.95 mgdL-1 and an average time lag of 17.14+/-2.67 min for an horizon of 30 min. Its performance is considerably better than that of time-invariant (regularized) linear regression models.","type+1+diabetes",["This","study","aims","at","demonstrating","the","need","for","nonlinear","recursive","models","to","the","identification","and","prediction","of","the","dynamic","glucose","system","in","type","1","diabetes.","Nonlinear","regression","is","performed","in","a","reproducing","kernel","Hilbert","space,","by","the","Approximate","Linear","Dependency","Kernel","Recursive","Least","Squares","(KRLS-ALD)","algorithm,","such","that","a","sparse","model","structure","is","accomplished.","The","method","is","evaluated","on","seven","people","with","type","1","diabetes","in","free-living","conditions,","where","a","change","in","glycaemic","dynamics","is","forced","by","increasing","the","level","of","physical","activity","in","the","middle","of","the","observational","period.","The","univariate","input","allows","for","short-term","(</=30","min)","predictions","with","KRLS-ALD","reaching","an","average","root","mean","square","error","of","15.22+/-5.95","mgdL-1","and","an","average","time","lag","of","17.14+/-2.67","min","for","an","horizon","of","30","min.","Its","performance","is","considerably","better","than","that","of","time-invariant","(regularized)","linear","regression","models."],["study","aims","demonstrating","need","nonlinear","recursive","models","identification","prediction","dynamic","glucose","system","type","1","diabetes.","Nonlinear","regression","performed","reproducing","kernel","Hilbert","space,","Approximate","Linear","Dependency","Kernel","Recursive","Least","Squares","(KRLS-ALD)","algorithm,","sparse","model","structure","accomplished.","method","evaluated","seven","people","type","1","diabetes","free-living","conditions,","change","glycaemic","dynamics","forced","increasing","level","physical","activity","middle","observational","period.","univariate","input","allows","short-term","(</=30","min)","predictions","KRLS-ALD","reaching","average","root","mean","square","error","15.22+/-5.95","mgdL-1","average","time","lag","17.14+/-2.67","min","horizon","30","min.","performance","considerably","better","time-invariant","(regularized)","linear","regression","models."],[0,300,[3,12,13,14,17,26,33,36,37,39,44,49,50,56,57,58,61,76,79,85,86,92,100,101,103,109,110,114,115,116,118,119,120,121,125,130,136,137,139,142,144,146,153,157,163,164,167,172,180,183,184,185,199,207,208,216,219,220,226,229,235,241,242,249,251,253,254,257,258,259,261,273,293,295,299],[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0]],[0,300,[3,12,13,14,17,26,33,36,37,39,44,49,50,56,57,58,61,76,79,85,86,92,100,101,103,109,110,114,115,116,118,119,120,121,125,130,136,137,139,142,144,146,153,157,163,164,167,172,180,183,184,185,199,207,208,216,219,220,226,229,235,241,242,249,251,253,254,257,258,259,261,273,293,295,299],[1.2687207539339787,1.1656416591140484,0.9827156900925671,3.240096183092232,1.0525721194915603,1.7717007423116262,1.195091640190978,1.1536222836482644,1.1851783000223266,0.8034198542151494,1.5644782403913051,0.5715601900605748,0.9174221670316269,0.9509984625652311,1.6768704274128121,1.4204168972170694,1.4537268760986024,1.3337956119039294,2.9897698971842197,0.9908047129656508,1.3195908276056123,1.2890328943879612,1.0375664788736902,1.315368442725764,1.6648462344460104,1.0196429626847854,1.0418308776601477,1.2126800332918655,2.1844497828231084,0.7743842184505674,1.0810515908134288,2.913915793360098,0.9877636563898717,0.8246882016190752,1.4683493949661444,1.10238872820156,0.8084831561716962,1.340974393630935,0.8490584242222367,3.415158168063957,1.3660429223855652,2.0371971523337584,1.6257787662551009,1.9795799990702083,1.3613535559675873,1.1080802632013482,1.4266766985655763,0.8722323667873726,0.5576388515419669,1.5808273783928346,1.0354410795613767,1.3280894623270747,1.3238311166444976,1.2863006522510883,1.078831834075116,0.9807036169791469,0.9269009109861707,0.9422562990693651,1.7264673685521843,1.4948849485921099,1.6569096848502742,1.484851419602532,1.1149531424891101,0.9897899995351042,1.6143500704314782,1.1839460139760616,1.5651888903873792,1.8864477700362021,1.34386039852007,1.2357579805744103,1.3266679979796974,1.0113182527987536,0.9786955841759014,1.4987052658897475,0.7390391738166007]],1.0],["Lipid nanoparticle delivery of glucagon receptor siRNA improves glucose homeostasis in mouse models of diabetes.",["Neumann UH","Ho JSS","Chen S","Tam YYC","Cullis PR","Kieffer TJ"],"Mol Metab. 2017 Oct;6(10):1161-1172. doi: 10.1016/j.molmet.2017.06.012. Epub 2017 Jun 22.","OBJECTIVE: Hyperglucagonemia is present in many forms of diabetes and contributes to hyperglycemia, and glucagon suppression can ameliorate diabetes in mice. Leptin, a glucagon suppressor, can also reverse diabetes in rodents. Lipid nanoparticle (LNP) delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) effectively targets the liver and is in clinical trials for the treatment of various diseases. We compared the effectiveness of glucagon receptor (Gcgr)-siRNA delivered via LNPs to leptin in two mouse models of diabetes. METHODS: Gcgr siRNA encapsulated into LNPs or leptin was administered to mice with diabetes due to injection of the beta-cell toxin streptozotocin (STZ) alone or combined with high fat diet (HFD/STZ). RESULTS: In STZ-diabetic mice, a single injection of Gcgr siRNA lowered blood glucose levels for 3 weeks, improved glucose tolerance, and normalized plasma ketones levels, while leptin therapy normalized blood glucose levels, oral glucose tolerance, and plasma ketones, and suppressed lipid metabolism. In contrast, in HFD/STZ-diabetic mice, Gcgr siRNA lowered blood glucose levels for 2 months, improved oral glucose tolerance, and reduced HbA1c, while leptin had no beneficial effects. CONCLUSIONS: While leptin may be more effective than Gcgr siRNA at normalizing both glucose and lipid metabolism in STZ diabetes, Gcgr siRNA is more effective at reducing blood glucose levels in HFD/STZ diabetes.","type+1+diabetes",["OBJECTIVE:","Hyperglucagonemia","is","present","in","many","forms","of","diabetes","and","contributes","to","hyperglycemia,","and","glucagon","suppression","can","ameliorate","diabetes","in","mice.","Leptin,","a","glucagon","suppressor,","can","also","reverse","diabetes","in","rodents.","Lipid","nanoparticle","(LNP)","delivery","of","small","interfering","RNA","(siRNA)","effectively","targets","the","liver","and","is","in","clinical","trials","for","the","treatment","of","various","diseases.","We","compared","the","effectiveness","of","glucagon","receptor","(Gcgr)-siRNA","delivered","via","LNPs","to","leptin","in","two","mouse","models","of","diabetes.","METHODS:","Gcgr","siRNA","encapsulated","into","LNPs","or","leptin","was","administered","to","mice","with","diabetes","due","to","injection","of","the","beta-cell","toxin","streptozotocin","(STZ)","alone","or","combined","with","high","fat","diet","(HFD/STZ).","RESULTS:","In","STZ-diabetic","mice,","a","single","injection","of","Gcgr","siRNA","lowered","blood","glucose","levels","for","3","weeks,","improved","glucose","tolerance,","and","normalized","plasma","ketones","levels,","while","leptin","therapy","normalized","blood","glucose","levels,","oral","glucose","tolerance,","and","plasma","ketones,","and","suppressed","lipid","metabolism.","In","contrast,","in","HFD/STZ-diabetic","mice,","Gcgr","siRNA","lowered","blood","glucose","levels","for","2","months,","improved","oral","glucose","tolerance,","and","reduced","HbA1c,","while","leptin","had","no","beneficial","effects.","CONCLUSIONS:","While","leptin","may","be","more","effective","than","Gcgr","siRNA","at","normalizing","both","glucose","and","lipid","metabolism","in","STZ","diabetes,","Gcgr","siRNA","is","more","effective","at","reducing","blood","glucose","levels","in","HFD/STZ","diabetes."],["OBJECTIVE:","Hyperglucagonemia","present","many","forms","diabetes","contributes","hyperglycemia,","glucagon","suppression","ameliorate","diabetes","mice.","Leptin,","glucagon","suppressor,","also","reverse","diabetes","rodents.","Lipid","nanoparticle","(LNP)","delivery","small","interfering","RNA","(siRNA)","effectively","targets","liver","clinical","trials","treatment","various","diseases.","compared","effectiveness","glucagon","receptor","(Gcgr)-siRNA","delivered","via","LNPs","leptin","two","mouse","models","diabetes.","METHODS:","Gcgr","siRNA","encapsulated","LNPs","leptin","administered","mice","diabetes","due","injection","beta-cell","toxin","streptozotocin","(STZ)","alone","combined","high","fat","diet","(HFD/STZ).","RESULTS:","STZ-diabetic","mice,","single","injection","Gcgr","siRNA","lowered","blood","glucose","levels","3","weeks,","improved","glucose","tolerance,","normalized","plasma","ketones","levels,","leptin","therapy","normalized","blood","glucose","levels,","oral","glucose","tolerance,","plasma","ketones,","suppressed","lipid","metabolism.","contrast,","HFD/STZ-diabetic","mice,","Gcgr","siRNA","lowered","blood","glucose","levels","2","months,","improved","oral","glucose","tolerance,","reduced","HbA1c,","leptin","beneficial","effects.","CONCLUSIONS:","leptin","may","effective","Gcgr","siRNA","normalizing","glucose","lipid","metabolism","STZ","diabetes,","Gcgr","siRNA","effective","reducing","blood","glucose","levels","HFD/STZ","diabetes."],[0,300,[5,8,9,14,17,19,22,24,28,31,32,34,39,42,53,54,55,57,61,69,70,73,75,80,89,90,92,95,99,107,115,116,118,119,120,121,130,138,143,146,149,152,154,161,162,164,166,167,168,169,173,180,182,185,188,192,196,199,202,208,210,211,215,216,218,219,220,225,230,231,235,238,240,245,246,247,251,256,259,264,267,269,274,277,282,286,288,293,295,299],[2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,8.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]],[0,300,[5,8,9,14,17,19,22,24,28,31,32,34,39,42,53,54,55,57,61,69,70,73,75,80,89,90,92,95,99,107,115,116,118,119,120,121,130,138,143,146,149,152,154,161,162,164,166,167,168,169,173,180,182,185,188,192,196,199,202,208,210,211,215,216,218,219,220,225,230,231,235,238,240,245,246,247,251,256,259,264,267,269,274,277,282,286,288,293,295,299],[3.4957629261120013,1.89420723660738,2.1598821930588032,1.620048091546116,2.1051442389831205,1.597448259628875,1.158412711970897,0.4963561184809827,3.386526763949332,2.9236481726624435,1.1988346264698124,1.4601993906042199,3.2136794168605975,0.8464187394514634,0.8931898536438588,1.3912065191172684,0.8289966960047991,1.6768704274128121,1.4537268760986024,1.3083705135381192,1.0777238007207541,1.0733039040226031,0.9958937824731221,1.4650814182015282,1.2318744805480126,1.0040905496773007,1.2890328943879612,0.8118729899262077,0.7311774981052004,1.4831889088289185,2.1844497828231084,0.7743842184505674,1.0810515908134

life and fertility desire become of particular concern. Pregnancy in pancreas-alone transplantation, although rare and complicated to manage, is not impossible anymore. We here report such a case with literature review to address this issue. CASE REPORT: A 29-year-old, primigravida patient with underlying stage 4 chronic renal insufficiency and type 1 diabetes mellitus post pancreas-alone transplantation 5 years prior to her initial visit consulted our service. Antepartum care with intensive monitoring of blood pressure, renal function, and tacrolimus serum concentration were given. Successful maternal and fetal outcomes are presented here. CONCLUSION: Child-bearing in solid organ transplantation recipients has become more promising nowadays, even for a difficult case of pancreas-alone transplant recipient complicated with chronic renal insufficiency and superimposed pre-eclampsia. Thorough antepartum counseling and cautious monitoring of maternal, fetal and graft conditions by multidisciplinary specialties are key to favorable pregnancy outcomes.","type+1+diabetes",["OBJECTIVE:","With","the","prolonged","life","expectancy","in","solid","organ","transplant","recipients,","their","quality","of","life","and","fertility","desire","become","of","particular","concern.","Pregnancy","in","pancreas-alone","transplantation,","although","rare","and","complicated","to","manage,","is","not","impossible","anymore.","We","here","report","such","a","case","with","literature","review","to","address","this","issue.","CASE","REPORT:","A","29-year-old,","primigravida","patient","with","underlying","stage","4","chronic","renal","insufficiency","and","type","1","diabetes","mellitus","post","pancreas-alone","transplantation","5","years","prior","to","her","initial","visit","consulted","our","service.","Antepartum","care","with","intensive","monitoring","of","blood","pressure,","renal","function,","and","tacrolimus","serum","concentration","were","given.","Successful","maternal","and","fetal","outcomes","are","presented","here.","CONCLUSION:","Child-bearing","in","solid","organ","transplantation","recipients","has","become","more","promising","nowadays,","even","for","a","difficult","case","of","pancreas-alone","transplant","recipient","complicated","with","chronic","renal","insufficiency","and","superimposed","pre-eclampsia.","Thorough","antepartum","counseling","and","cautious","monitoring","of","maternal,","fetal","and","graft","conditions","by","multidisciplinary","specialties","are","key","to","favorable","pregnancy","outcomes."],["OBJECTIVE:","prolonged","life","expectancy","solid","organ","transplant","recipients,","quality","life","fertility","desire","become","particular","concern.","Pregnancy","pancreas-alone","transplantation,","although","rare","complicated","manage,","impossible","anymore.","report","case","literature","review","address","issue.","CASE","REPORT:","29-year-old,","primigravida","patient","underlying","stage","4","chronic","renal","insufficiency","type","1","diabetes","mellitus","post","pancreas-alone","transplantation","5","years","prior","initial","visit","consulted","service.","Antepartum","care","intensive","monitoring","blood","pressure,","renal","function,","tacrolimus","serum","concentration","given.","Successful","maternal","fetal","outcomes","presented","here.","CONCLUSION:","Child-bearing","solid","organ","transplantation","recipients","become","promising","nowadays,","even","difficult","case","pancreas-alone","transplant","recipient","complicated","chronic","renal","insufficiency","superimposed","pre-eclampsia.","Thorough","antepartum","counseling","cautious","monitoring","maternal,","fetal","graft","conditions","multidisciplinary","specialties","key","favorable","pregnancy","outcomes."],[0,300,[5,6,11,17,19,20,21,26,29,33,39,42,45,46,48,55,57,65,66,67,73,76,77,80,82,93,96,97,108,113,115,117,120,121,126,128,129,130,131,133,136,138,139,144,148,152,154,160,165,166,168,172,182,184,190,194,196,198,200,204,210,215,221,226,227,228,238,240,241,244,249,251,252,255,262,273,279,280,284,293,296],[1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0]],[0,300,[5,6,11,17,19,20,21,26,29,33,39,42,45,46,48,55,57,65,66,67,73,76,77,80,82,93,96,97,108,113,115,117,120,121,126,128,129,130,131,133,136,138,139,144,148,152,154,160,165,166,168,172,182,184,190,194,196,198,200,204,210,215,221,226,227,228,238,240,241,244,249,251,252,255,262,273,279,280,284,293,296],[1.7478814630560007,1.0010088831398924,4.236290736378614,2.1051442389831205,1.597448259628875,1.0154719451674472,1.4080136374336496,1.7717007423116262,1.3540275158755144,2.390183280381956,0.8034198542151494,1.6928374789029268,1.1729232446853115,0.9374323630385122,2.1466078080452062,1.6579933920095982,5.030611282238437,2.816027274867299,1.1926040767191763,1.162020653347096,1.0733039040226031,1.3337956119039294,2.773342727903754,1.4650814182015282,1.2945198766042203,1.1364559287695304,3.213303779880782,1.1913626116311113,1.3687336632652098,1.0428998248490526,1.0922248914115542,1.4881847560222903,1.9755273127797435,0.8246882016190752,1.1393871678263923,1.3424163549478365,1.7122636801959268,2.20477745640312,1.4634514259905973,1.4313973997005138,0.8084831561716962,1.4313973997005138,0.8490584242222367,0.6830214611927826,2.3048565073113134,1.3988111185024876,1.5343073627579418,1.252762968495368,1.2767961679395243,2.37012518480692,1.0196429626847854,0.8722323667873726,1.6992974632002564,1.0354410795613767,1.4126468503551377,2.2299062849782203,0.8307253049054169,1.376168641752728,1.4064739912480568,1.190122685867791,1.162020653347096,1.1668515806167616,2.650497102650942,1.7264673685521843,1.395762335653129,1.7075790840319784,1.229293833954521,1.158412711970897,1.484851419602532,1.1126569302287599,2.9693699986053126,1.6143500704314782,0

negatively impact child functioning. However, little is known about mechanisms that may buffer the adverse impact of parental distress. The current study explored the possible buffering role of maternal adaptive cognitive emotion regulation (CER) for the relationship between maternal distress and child psychological functioning. Forty-three children with T1D (8-15 years) completed measures assessing trait anxiety and depressive symptoms. Their mothers reported on general distress, illness-related parenting stress, and adaptive CER. Maternal illness-related parenting stress (but not general distress) was significantly associated with child psychological functioning. No buffering role for maternal adaptive CER was observed. As the current study is rather preliminary, future research using other methods to examine maternal adaptive CER, and examining other parental variables that may buffer against the negative impact of parental distress is warranted.","type+1+diabetes",["Parents","of","children","with","Type","1","diabetes","(T1D)","experience","high","levels","of","distress,","which","may","negatively","impact","child","functioning.","However,","little","is","known","about","mechanisms","that","may","buffer","the","adverse","impact","of","parental","distress.","The","current","study","explored","the","possible","buffering","role","of","maternal","adaptive","cognitive","emotion","regulation","(CER)","for","the","relationship","between","maternal","distress","and","child","psychological","functioning.","Forty-three","children","with","T1D","(8-15","years)","completed","measures","assessing","trait","anxiety","and","depressive","symptoms.","Their","mothers","reported","on","general","distress,","illness-related","parenting","stress,","and","adaptive","CER.","Maternal","illness-related","parenting","stress","(but","not","general","distress)","was","significantly","associated","with","child","psychological","functioning.","No","buffering","role","for","maternal","adaptive","CER","was","observed.","As","the","current","study","is","rather","preliminary,","future","research","using","other","methods","to","examine","maternal","adaptive","CER,","and","examining","other","parental","variables","that","may","buffer","against","the","negative","impact","of","parental","distress","is","warranted."],["Parents","children","Type","1","diabetes","(T1D)","experience","high","levels","distress,","may","negatively","impact","child","functioning.","However,","little","known","mechanisms","may","buffer","adverse","impact","parental","distress.","current","study","explored","possible","buffering","role","maternal","adaptive","cognitive","emotion","regulation","(CER)","relationship","maternal","distress","child","psychological","functioning.","Forty-three","children","T1D","(8-15","years)","completed","measures","assessing","trait","anxiety","depressive","symptoms.","mothers","reported","general","distress,","illness-related","parenting","stress,","adaptive","CER.","Maternal","illness-related","parenting","stress","(but","general","distress)","significantly","associated","child","psychological","functioning.","buffering","role","maternal","adaptive","CER","observed.","current","study","rather","preliminary,","future","research","using","methods","examine","maternal","adaptive","CER,","examining","parental","variables","may","buffer","negative","impact","parental","distress","warranted."],[0,300,[0,10,11,18,23,24,25,29,30,31,35,39,40,41,44,49,50,52,53,67,68,70,72,73,81,87,91,92,95,110,130,134,137,144,146,155,159,160,161,166,174,177,181,184,187,212,216,220,221,223,227,232,237,239,245,248,249,253,260,261,264,271,272,288,290,292,295,297],[1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]],[0,300,[0,10,11,18,23,24,25,29,30,31,35,39,40,41,44,49,50,52,53,67,68,70,72,73,81,87,91,92,95,110,130,134,137,144,146,155,159,160,161,166,174,177,181,184,187,212,216,220,221,223,227,232,237,239,245,248,249,253,260,261,264,271,272,288,290,292,295,297],[1.229293833954521,2.8883245496671686,2.118145368189307,1.229293833954521,3.2362902828000593,0.4963561184809827,2.743787927387375,2.708055031751029,1.229293833954521,1.4618240863312217,4.5509277192189055,0.8034198542151494,1.0154719451674472,2.1422025199205215,1.5644782403913051,1.1431203801211496,1.8348443340632539,1.200085408371465,1.7863797072877177,2.324041306694192,1.3467547565464346,1.0777238007207541,0.9024406134160099,2.1466078080452062,1.3424163549478365,1.5881803526980935,1.4143836442411912,1.2890328943879612,0.8118729899262077,2.0836617553202954,1.10238872820156,1.014431903472033,1.340974393630935,0.6830214611927826,3.0557957285006374,1.730089110137078,4.341887957304936,5.011051873981472,2.432979123417066,2.37012518480692,1.1230316630543118,1.3776622940095111,5.6136071688443465,1.0354410795613767,1.400339002680541,0.9183660085363332,0.9807036169791469,0.9422562990693651,1.325248551325471,1.2038471682933567,1.395762335653129,1.1668515806167616,1.5602485832232544,1.256728604888715,0.9089674431126944,0.8950331721381481,1.9795799990702083,1.1839460139760616,1.1335151603491698,2.6533359959593947,1.5438684752831657,1.4618240863312217,0.9278537457414425,2.1621031816268577,1.2781484331895379,1.1092224677801252,0.7493526329448738,1.206362892890604]],1.0],["Medication

diabetes, and identify potential risk factors for these errors. METHODS: This prospective observational study included all people with Type 1 (n = 163) and Type 2 diabetes (n = 508) admitted to the Diabetology-Department of the University Hospital of Montpellier, France, between 2013 and 2015. Pharmacists conducted medication reconciliation within 24 h of admission and at hospital discharge. Medication history collected from different sources (patient/family interviews, prescriptions/medical records, contact with community pharmacies/general practitioners/nurses) was compared with admission and discharge prescriptions to detect unintentional discrepancies in medication indicating involuntary medication changes. Medication errors were defined as unintentional medication discrepancies corrected by physicians. Risk factors for medication errors and serious errors (i.e. errors that may cause harm) were assessed using logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 322 medication errors were identified and were mainly omissions. Prevalence of medication errors in Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes was 21.5% and 22.2% respectively at admission, and 9.0% and 12.2% at discharge. After adjusting for age and number of treatments, people with Type 1 diabetes had nearly a twofold higher odds of having medication errors (odds ratio (OR) 1.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-2.94) and serious errors (OR 2.17, 95% CI 1.02-4.76) at admission compared with those with Type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Medication reconciliation identified medication errors in one third of individuals.

known about how caregiving for children with T1D affects the parent/caregivers' health in low- and middle-income country settings. METHODS: Caregivers of 178 children with T1D from a specialized diabetes clinic in Maharashtra, India were surveyed. Ordered and standard logistic regression models adjusted for caregiver, household and child characteristics, were fit to estimate the association of caregiving burden (objective caregiving burden and subjective caregiving burden (Zarit Burden Inventory - tertiles)) with caregiver depression (Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9]) and well-being (CDC Unhealthy Days) outcomes. RESULTS: Caregivers with high subjective caregiving burden had a 41% probability of most severe depression category (probability: 0.41, 95% CI: 0.25, 0.57) and an 39% probability of low well-being (probability: 0.39, 95% CI: 0.27, 0.51), compared to caregivers with low subjective burden. Caregivers with high subjective caregiving burden and high objective direct caregiving burden had an adjusted 30% probability of elevated depressive symptoms (PHQ>/=10).

The pathophysiology of many autoimmune diseases may be attributed to molecular mimicry provoked by microbes. Molecular mimicry hypothesizes that a sequence homology between foreign and self-peptides leads to cross-activation of autoreactive T cells. Different microbial proteins are implicated in various autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis, human type 1 diabetes, primary biliary cirrhosis and rheumatoid arthritis. It may be imperative to identify the microbial epitopes that initiate the activation of autoreactive T cells. Consequently, in the present study, we employed immunoinformatics tools to delineate homologous antigenic regions between microbes and human proteins at not only the sequence level but at the structural level too. Interestingly, many cross-reactive MHC class II binding epitopes were detected from an array of microbes. Further, these peptides possess a potential to skew immune response toward Th1-like patterns. The present study divulges many microbial target proteins, their putative MHC-binding epitopes, and predicted structures to establish the fact that both sequence and structure are two important aspects for understanding the relationship between molecular mimicry and autoimmune diseases. Such findings may enable us in designing potential immunotherapies to tolerize autoreactive T

component of cigarettes, has demonstrated conflicting impact on the immune system: some authors suggest that increases pro-inflammatory cytokines and provokes cellular apoptosis of neutrophils, releasing intracellular components that act as auto-antigens; others claimed that nicotine has a protective and anti-inflammatory effects, especially by binding to alpha7 subunit of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. The cholinergic pathway contributes to an anti-inflammatory environment characterized by increasing T regulatory cells response, down-regulating of pro-inflammatory cytokines and a pro-inflammatory cells apoptosis. The effects of nicotine were studied in different autoimmune disease, as multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, Behcet's disease and inflammatory bowel diseases.

foveal avascular zone (FAZ) in children with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and compare potential pathologic early changes in this population to healthy age-matched controls. METHODS: This study included 130 pubescent children: 94 with T1D (188 eyes) and 36 of their age-matched control group (60 eyes). OCTA was performed using AngioVue (Avanti, Optivue). FAZ area (mm2) in superficial plexus, whole superficial capillary vessel density (wsVD), fovea superficial vessel density (fsVD), parafovea superficial vessel density (psVD), whole deep vessel density (wdVD), fovea deep vessel density (fdVD), parafovea deep vessel density (pdVD), foveal thickness (FT) (mum) and parafoveal thickness (PFT) (mum) were taken into analysis. Among the studied patients with T1D there were assessed codependences regarding the investigated foveal and parafoveal parameters and selected potential predictors, i.e. patient's age (years), diabetes duration time (years), age of onset of the disease (years), mean level of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) (%), and concentration of serum creatinine (mg/dL). RESULTS: None of the abovementioned OCT and OCTA parameters was statistically significantly different between the groups. The patient's age statistically significantly did not influent any of the OCT and OCTA parameters. Yet an elevated level of HbA1C tended to reduce the parafovea superficial vessel density (p = 0.039), and parafoveal thickness (p = 0.003) and an increased serum creatinine level correlated with the decreased whole deep vessel density (p < 0.001). The parafovea deep vessel density in the diabetic patients decreased when the serum creatinine level (p = 0.008), age of onset of the disease (p = 0.028), and diabetes duration time (p = 0.014) rose. CONCLUSIONS: Vessel density, both in superficial and deep plexuses, and FAZ area are normal in pubescent children with T1D comparing to healthy subjects. An elevated level of HbA1C correlated with reduced psVD and PFT.

histone deacetylase inhibitor synergises with T cell targeted immunotherapy to preserve beta cell metabolic function and induce stable remission of new-onset autoimmune diabetes in NOD

targeting the major actors involved in the immune-mediated destruction of pancreatic beta cells appears to be an indispensable approach to treat type 1 diabetes effectively. We hypothesised that the combination of an orally active pan-histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi: givinostat) with subtherapeutic doses of CD3 antibodies may provide ideal synergy to treat ongoing autoimmunity. METHODS: NOD mice transgenic for the human CD3epsilon (also known as CD3E) chain (NOD-huCD3epsilon) were treated for recent-onset diabetes with oral givinostat, subtherapeutic doses of humanised CD3 antibodies (otelixizumab, 50 mug/day, 5 days, i.v.) or a combination of both drugs. Disease remission, metabolic profiles and autoreactive T cell responses were analysed in treated mice. RESULTS: We demonstrated that givinostat synergised with otelixizumab to induce durable remission of diabetes in 80% of recently diabetic NOD-huCD3epsilon mice. Remission was obtained in only 47% of mice treated with otelixizumab alone. Oral givinostat monotherapy did not reverse established diabetes but reduced the in situ production of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha). Importantly, the otelixizumab + givinostat combination strongly improved the metabolic status of NOD-huCD3epsilon mice; the mice recovered the capacity to appropriately produce insulin, control hyperglycaemia and sustain glucose tolerance. Finally, diabetes remission induced by the combination therapy was associated with a significant reduction of insulitis and autoantigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: HDACi and low-dose CD3 antibodies synergised to abrogate in situ inflammation and thereby improved pancreatic beta cell survival and metabolic function leading to long-lasting diabetes remission.

This medical device system consists in the association of a subcutaneous continuous glucose monitor (CGM) providing a proxy of the patient's glycaemia and a control algorithm offering the real-time modification of the insulin delivery with an automatic command of the subcutaneous insulin pump. The most complex algorithms are based on a compartmental model of the glucoregulatory system of the patient coupled to an approach of MPC (Model-Predictive-Control) for the command. The automatic and unsupervised control of insulin regulation constitutes a major challenge in AP projects. A given model with its parameterization on the shelf will not directly represent the patient's data behavior and the personalization of the model is a prerequisite before using it in a MPC. The present paper focuses on the personalization of a compartmental showing a method where taking into account the estimation of the patient's state in addition to the parameter estimation improves

activity (LTPA) and its exercise components intensity, duration, and frequency are associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in patients with type 1 diabetes 1) overall, 2) stratified by presence or absence of chronic kidney disease (CKD), and 3) stratified by sex. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study design was prospective and observational and included 2,639 patients with type 1 diabetes from the ongoing nationwide multicenter Finnish Diabetic Nephropathy (FinnDiane) Study. Mean follow-up time was 11.4 +/- 3.5 years. LTPA was assessed by using a validated self-report questionnaire. Three hundred ten patients (11.7%) had CKD defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate of </=60 mL/min/1.73 m2. RESULTS: During follow-up, 270 deaths occurred. LTPA and all its components were associated with all-cause mortality, even after adjustment for the potential confounders sex, diabetic nephropathy, duration of diabetes, age at onset of diabetes, systolic blood pressure, triglycerides, BMI, and HbA1c. Only exercise intensity was associated with cardiovascular mortality after adjustment for the confounders. Of the patients with CKD, 127 died during follow-up. The total amount of LTPA and exercise frequency were independently associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality when adjusted for covariates. CONCLUSIONS: Exercise is associated with a lower risk of premature all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in patients with type 1 diabetes. This study also demonstrates that physical activity is associated with a lower risk of mortality in patients with type 1 diabetes and CKD.","type+1+diabetes",["OBJECTIVE:","The","aims","of","the","study","were","to","assess","how","baseline","leisure-time","physical","activity","(LTPA)","and","its","exercise","components","intensity,","duration,","and","frequency","are","associated","with","all-cause","and","cardiovascular","mortality","in","patients","with","type","1","diabetes","1)","overall,","2)","stratified","by","presence","or","absence","of","chronic","kidney","disease","(CKD),","and","3)","stratified","by","sex.","RESEARCH","DESIGN","AND","METHODS:","The","study","design","was","prospective","and","observational","and","included","2,639","patients","with","type","1","diabetes","from","the","ongoing","nationwide","multicenter","Finnish","Diabetic","Nephropathy","(FinnDiane)","Study.","Mean","follow-up","time","was","11.4","+/-","3.5","years.","LTPA","was","assessed","by","using","a","validated","self-report","questionnaire.","Three","hundred","ten","patients","(11.7%)","had","CKD","defined","as","an","estimated","glomerular","filtration","rate","of","</=60","mL/min/1.73","m2.","RESULTS:","During","follow-up,","270","deaths","occurred.","LTPA","and","all","its","components","were","associated","with","all-cause","mortality,","even","after","adjustment","for","the","potential","confounders","sex,","diabetic","nephropathy,","duration","of","diabetes,","age","at","onset","of","diabetes,","systolic","blood","pressure,","triglycerides,","BMI,","and","HbA1c.","Only","exercise","intensity","was","associated","with","cardiovascular","mortality","after","adjustment","for","the","confounders.","Of","the","patients","with","CKD,","127","died","during","follow-up.","The","total","amount","of","LTPA","and","exercise","frequency","were","independently","associated","with","lower","risk","of","all-cause","mortality","when","adjusted","for","covariates.","CONCLUSIONS:","Exercise","is","associated","with","a","lower","risk","of","premature","all-cause","and","cardiovascular","mortality","in","patients","with","type","1","diabetes.","This","study","also","demonstrates","that","physical","activity","is","associated","with","a","lower","risk","of","mortality","in","patients","with","type","1","diabetes","and","CKD."],["OBJECTIVE:","aims","study","assess","baseline","leisure-time","physical","activity","(LTPA)","exercise","components","intensity,","duration,","frequency","associated","all-cause","cardiovascular","mortality","patients","type","1","diabetes","1)","overall,","2)","stratified","presence","absence","chronic","kidney","disease","(CKD),","3)","stratified","sex.","RESEARCH","DESIGN","METHODS:","study","design","prospective","observational","included","2,639","patients","type","1","diabetes","ongoing","nationwide","multicenter","Finnish","Diabetic","Nephropathy","(FinnDiane)","Study.","Mean","follow-up","time","11.4","+/-","3.5","years.","LTPA","assessed","using","validated","self-report","questionnaire.","Three","hundred","ten","patients","(11.7%)","CKD","defined","estimated","glomerular","filtration","rate","</=60","mL/min/1.73","m2.","RESULTS:","follow-up,","270","deaths","occurred.","LTPA","components","associated","all-cause","mortality,","even","adjustment","potential","confounders","sex,","diabetic","nephropathy,","duration","diabetes,","age","onset","diabetes,","systolic","blood","pressure,","triglycerides,","BMI,","HbA1c.","exercise","intensity","associated","cardiovascular","mortality","adjustment","confounders.","patients","CKD,","127","died","follow-up.","total","amount","LTPA","exercise","frequency","independently","associated","lower","risk","all-cause","mortality","adjusted","covariates.","CONCLUSIONS:","Exercise","associated","lower","risk","premature","all-cause","cardiovascular","mortality","patients","type","1","diabetes.","study","also","demonstrates","physical","activity","associated","lower","risk","mortality","patients","type","1","diabetes","CKD."],[0,300,[0,1,6,8,10,11,17,20,21,24,26,34,37,39,40,41,44,49,51,52,53,62,64,67,73,75,76,83,84,85,87,91,92,98,99,102,107,108,110,115,116,118,120,127,129,133,144,150,155,157,159,162,165,166,168,171,173,175,176,177,180,187,190,192,199,201,202,206,213,218,221,222,229,233,234,236,237,239,240,243,244,247,248,249,253,255,257,260,262,263,265,266,275,277,279,280,286,287,289,293,294],[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0]],[0,300,[0,1,6,8,10,11,17,20,21,24,26,34,37,39,40,41,44,49,51,52,53,62,64,67,73,75,76,83,84,85,87,91,92,98,99,102,107,108,110,115,116,118,120,127,129,133,144,150,155,157,159,162,165,166,168,171,173,175,176,177,180,187,190,192,199,201,202,206,213,218,221,222,229,233,234,236,237,239,240,243,244,247,248,249,253,255,

association between plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentration and islet autoimmunity(IA); and whether vitamin D gene polymorphisms modify the effect of 25(OH)D on IA risk. We followed 8676 children at increased genetic risk of type 1 diabetes(T1D) at 6 sites in the US and Europe. We defined IA as positivity for at least one autoantibody (GADA, IAA or IA-2A) on 2 or more visits. We conducted a risk-set sampled nested case-control study of 376 IA cases and up to 3 controls per case. 25(OH)D concentration was measured on all samples prior to, and including the first IA positive visit. Nine polymorphisms in VDR, CYP24A, CYP27B1, GC, and RXRA were analyzed as effect modifiers of 25(OH)D. Adjusting for HLA-DR-DQ and ancestry, higher childhood 25(OH)D was associated with lower IA risk (odds ratio(OR): 0.93 for a 5 nmol/L difference; 95% confidence interval(CI): 0.89,0.97).

even replaces the absolute requirement for injected insulin. The need for multiple drug therapy of comorbidities associated with T1DM increases demand for developing novel therapeutic alternatives with new mechanisms of actions. Compared to other sulphonylurea drugs used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, gliclazide exhibits a pleiotropic action outside pancreatic beta cells, the so-called extrapancreatic effects, such as antiinflammatory and cellular protective effects, which might be beneficial in the treatment of T1DM. Results from in vivo experiments confirmed the positive effects of gliclazide in T1DM that are even more pronounced when combined with other hypoglycaemic agents such as probiotics and bile acids. Even though the exact mechanism of interaction at the molecular level is still unknown, there is a clear synergistic effect between gliclazide, bile acids and probiotics illustrated by the reduction of blood glucose levels and improvement of diabetic complications. Therefore, the manipulation of bile acid pool and intestinal microbiota composition in combination with old drug gliclazide could be a novel therapeutic approach for patients with T1DM.","type+1+diabetes",["A","major","advancement","in","therapy","of","type","1","diabetes","mellitus","(T1DM)","is","the","discovery","of","new","treatment","which","avoids","and","even","replaces","the","absolute","requirement","for","injected","insulin.","The","need","for","multiple","drug","therapy","of","comorbidities","associated","with","T1DM","increases","demand","for","developing","novel","therapeutic","alternatives","with","new","mechanisms","of","actions.","Compared","to","other","sulphonylurea","drugs","used","in","the","treatment","of","type","2","diabetes","mellitus,","gliclazide","exhibits","a","pleiotropic","action","outside","pancreatic","beta","cells,","the","so-called","extrapancreatic","effects,","such","as","antiinflammatory","and","cellular","protective","effects,","which","might","be","beneficial","in","the","treatment","of","T1DM.","Results","from","in","vivo","experiments","confirmed","the","positive","effects","of","gliclazide","in","T1DM","that","are","even","more","pronounced","when","combined","with","other","hypoglycaemic","agents","such","as","probiotics","and","bile","acids.","Even","though","the","exact","mechanism","of","interaction","at","the","molecular","level","is","still","unknown,","there","is","a","clear","synergistic","effect","between","gliclazide,","bile","acids","and","probiotics","illustrated","by","the","reduction","of","blood","glucose","levels","and","improvement","of","diabetic","complications.","Therefore,","the","manipulation","of","bile","acid","pool","and","intestinal","microbiota","composition","in","combination","with","old","drug","gliclazide","could","be","a","novel","therapeutic","approach","for","patients","with","T1DM."],["major","advancement","therapy","type","1","diabetes","mellitus","(T1DM)","discovery","new","treatment","avoids","even","replaces","absolute","requirement","injected","insulin.","need","multiple","drug","therapy","comorbidities","associated","T1DM","increases","demand","developing","novel","therapeutic","alternatives","new","mechanisms","actions.","Compared","sulphonylurea","drugs","used","treatment","type","2","diabetes","mellitus,","gliclazide","exhibits","pleiotropic","action","outside","pancreatic","beta","cells,","so-called","extrapancreatic","effects,","antiinflammatory","cellular","protective","effects,","might","beneficial","treatment","T1DM.","Results","vivo","experiments","confirmed","positive","effects","gliclazide","T1DM","even","pronounced","combined","hypoglycaemic","agents","probiotics","bile","acids.","Even","though","exact","mechanism","interaction","molecular","level","still","unknown,","clear","synergistic","effect","gliclazide,","bile","acids","probiotics","illustrated","reduction","blood","glucose","levels","improvement","diabetic","complications.","Therefore,","manipulation","bile","acid","pool","intestinal","microbiota","composition","combination","old","drug","gliclazide","novel","therapeutic","approach","patients","T1DM."],[0,300,[0,6,7,8,13,24,25,26,36,37,39,43,45,49,62,66,69,71,72,73,75,76,79,81,83,86,89,90,91,93,97,100,101,102,104,107,109,115,124,127,128,130,136,139,141,144,145,149,152,157,160,161,164,165,168,172,173,176,191,193,199,200,201,205,210,211,212,214,215,218,219,220,231,232,239,240,243,250,254,260,264,277,278,285,291,292,295],[1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0]],[0,300,[0,6,7,8,13,24,25,26,36,37,39,43,45,49,62,66,69,71,72,73,75,76,79,81,83,86,89,90,91,93,97,100,101,102,104,107,109,115,124,127,128,130,136,139,141,144,145,149,152,157,160,161,164,165,168,172,173,176,191,193,199,200,201,205,210,211,212,214,215,218,219,220,231,232,239,240,243,250,254,260,264,277,278,285,291,292,295],[1.229293833954521,3.0030266494196773,1.6910838646628676,0.94710361830369,1.9654313801851342,0.4963561184809827,3.658383903183167,1.7717007423116262,1.1536222836482644,1.1851783000223266,1.6068397084302988,3.7981301284897873,1.1729232446853115,0.5715601900605748,1.2472534875491068,1.1926040767191763,1.3083705135381192,1.1288422546497774,0.9024406134160099,1.0733039040226031,0.9958937824731221,1.3337956119039294,1.4948849485921099,1.3424163549478365,0.9578511570272716,1.3195908276056123,2.4637489610960253,1.0040905496773007,0.7071918221205956,0.5682279643847652,1.1913626116311113,1.0375664788736902,1.315368442725764,1.216489561708533,2.1934588070653174,1.4831889088289185,2.0392859253695708,1.0922248914115542,1.4831889088289185,1.3540275158755144,2.684832709895673,2.20477745640312,0.8084831561716962,0.8490584242222367,1.4204168972170694,0.6830214611927826,3.161654756785669,3.096784279931991,1.3988111185024876,1.9795799990702083,1.252762968495368,1.216489561708533,2.2161605264026965,1.2767961679395243,1.01964296

diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is limited by a lack of animal models exhibiting progressive kidney disease. Chronic hypertension, a driving factor of disease progression in human patients, is lacking in most available models of diabetes. We hypothesized that superimposition of hypertension on diabetic mouse models would accelerate DKD. To test this possibility, we induced persistent hypertension in three mouse models of type 1 diabetes and two models of type 2 diabetes by adeno-associated virus delivery of renin (ReninAAV). Compared with LacZAAV-treated counterparts, ReninAAV-treated type 1 diabetic Akita/129 mice exhibited a substantial increase in albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) and serum creatinine level and more severe renal lesions. In type 2 models of diabetes (C57BKLS db/db and BTBR ob/ob mice), compared with LacZAAV, ReninAAV induced significant elevations in ACR and increased the incidence and severity of histopathologic findings, with increased serum creatinine detected only in the ReninAAV-treated db/db mice. The uninephrectomized ReninAAV db/db model was the most progressive model examined and further characterized. In this model, separate treatment of hyperglycemia with rosiglitazone or hypertension with lisinopril partially reduced ACR, consistent with independent contributions of these disorders to renal disease. Microarray analysis and comparison with human DKD showed common pathways affected in human disease and this model. These results identify novel models of progressive DKD that provide researchers with a facile and reliable method to study disease pathogenesis and support the development of therapeutics.","type+1+diabetes",["Progress","in","research","and","developing","therapeutics","to","prevent","diabetic","kidney","disease","(DKD)","is","limited","by","a","lack","of","animal","models","exhibiting","progressive","kidney","disease.","Chronic","hypertension,","a","driving","factor","of","disease","progression","in","human","patients,","is","lacking","in","most","available","models","of","diabetes.","We","hypothesized","that","superimposition","of","hypertension","on","diabetic","mouse","models","would","accelerate","DKD.","To","test","this","possibility,","we","induced","persistent","hypertension","in","three","mouse","models","of","type","1","diabetes","and","two","models","of","type","2","diabetes","by","adeno-associated","virus","delivery","of","renin","(ReninAAV).","Compared","with","LacZAAV-treated","counterparts,","ReninAAV-treated","type","1","diabetic","Akita/129","mice","exhibited","a","substantial","increase","in","albumin-to-creatinine","ratio","(ACR)","and","serum","creatinine","level","and","more","severe","renal","lesions.","In","type","2","models","of","diabetes","(C57BKLS","db/db","and","BTBR","ob/ob","mice),","compared","with","LacZAAV,","ReninAAV","induced","significant","elevations","in","ACR","and","increased","the","incidence","and","severity","of","histopathologic","findings,","with","increased","serum","creatinine","detected","only","in","the","ReninAAV-treated","db/db","mice.","The","uninephrectomized","ReninAAV","db/db","model","was","the","most","progressive","model","examined","and","further","characterized.","In","this","model,","separate","treatment","of","hyperglycemia","with","rosiglitazone","or","hypertension","with","lisinopril","partially","reduced","ACR,","consistent","with","independent","contributions","of","these","disorders","to","renal","disease.","Microarray","analysis","and","comparison","with","human","DKD","showed","common","pathways","affected","in","human","disease","and","this","model.","These","results","identify","novel","models","of","progressive","DKD","that","provide","researchers","with","a","facile","and","reliable","method","to","study","disease","pathogenesis","and","support","the","development","of","therapeutics."],["Progress","research","developing","therapeutics","prevent","diabetic","kidney","disease","(DKD)","limited","lack","animal","models","exhibiting","progressive","kidney","disease.","Chronic","hypertension,","driving","factor","disease","progression","human","patients,","lacking","available","models","diabetes.","hypothesized","superimposition","hypertension","diabetic","mouse","models","accelerate","DKD.","test","possibility,","induced","persistent","hypertension","three","mouse","models","type","1","diabetes","two","models","type","2","diabetes","adeno-associated","virus","delivery","renin","(ReninAAV).","Compared","LacZAAV-treated","counterparts,","ReninAAV-treated","type","1","diabetic","Akita/129","mice","exhibited","substantial","increase","albumin-to-creatinine","ratio","(ACR)","serum","creatinine","level","severe","renal","lesions.","type","2","models","diabetes","(C57BKLS","db/db","BTBR","ob/ob","mice),","compared","LacZAAV,","ReninAAV","induced","significant","elevations","ACR","increased","incidence","severity","histopathologic","findings,","increased","serum","creatinine","detected","ReninAAV-treated","db/db","mice.","uninephrectomized","ReninAAV","db/db","model","progressive","model","examined","characterized.","model,","separate","treatment","hyperglycemia","rosiglitazone","hypertension","lisinopril","partially","reduced","ACR,","consistent","independent","contributions","disorders","renal","disease.","Microarray","analysis","comparison","human","DKD","showed","common","pathways","affected","human","disease","model.","results","identify","novel","models","progressive","DKD","provide","researchers","facile","reliable","method","study","disease","pathogenesis","support","development","therapeutics."],[0,300,[1,4,9,16,17,20,26,28,32,33,39,40,42,48,49,50,53,54,55,56,57,58,62,63,66,71,74,76,80,83,86,88,89,90,91,94,95,96,98,100,102,103,107,109,115,122,123,128,132,134,135,136,139,140,144,149,156,157,162,163,168,172,175,176,182,186,188,190,191,196,199,201,203,204,206,208,210,214,216,218,223,225,229,232,236,238,240,245,250,254,256,263,264,266,267,268,270,271,274,275,282,286,288,290,293,299],[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,1.0]],[0,300,[1,4,9,16,17,20,26,28,32,33,39,40,42,48,49,50,53,54,55,56,57,58,62,63,66,71,74,76,80,83,86,88,89,90,91,94,95,96,98,100,102,103,107,109,115,122,123,128,132,134,135,136,139,140,144,149,156,157,162,163,168,172,1

2017.","The PTPN22R620W single nucleotide polymorphism increases the risk of developing multiple autoimmune diseases including type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. PTPN22 is highly expressed in antigen presenting cells (APCs) where the expression of the murine disease associated variant orthologue (Ptpn22R619W) is reported to dysregulate pattern recognition receptor signalling in dendritic cells (DCs) and promote T-cell proliferation. Because T-cell activation is dependent on DC antigen uptake, degradation and presentation, we analysed the efficiency of these functions in splenic and GM-CSF bone marrow derived DC from wild type (WT), Ptpn22-/- or Ptpn22R619W mutant mice. Results indicated no differential ability of DCs to uptake antigen via macropinocytosis or receptor-mediated endocytosis. Antigen degradation and presentation was also equal as was WT T-cell conjugate formation and subsequent T-cell proliferation. Despite the likely presence of multiple phosphatase-regulated pathways in the antigen uptake, processing and presentation pathways that we investigated, we observed that Ptpn22 and the R619W autoimmune associated variant were dispensable. These important findings indicate that under non-inflammatory conditions there is no requirement for Ptpn22 in DC dependent antigen uptake and T-cell activation. Our findings reveal that perturbations in antigen uptake and processing, a fundamental pathway determining adaptive immune responses, are unlikely to provide a mechanism for the risk associated with

resulting in beta-cell destruction mediated by islet-infiltrating leukocytes. The role of oxidative stress in human and murine models of T1D is highly significant as these noxious molecules contribute to diabetic complications and beta-cell destruction, but their direct impact on dysregulated autoimmune responses is highly understudied. Pro-inflammatory macrophages play a vital role in the initiation and effector phases of T1D by producing reactive oxygen species and pro-inflammatory cytokines to facilitate beta-cell destruction and by presenting antigen to autoreactive T cells. Recent evidence has demonstrated that macrophage differentiation and pro-inflammatory innate immune responses are regulated by the synthesis of free radicals. This review will focus on the synergistic effects of free radicals on macrophage responses in T1D and provide insight that redox modulation of innate immune responses may be an effective strategy to curtail autoimmune diabetes.","type+1+diabetes",["Type","1","diabetes","(T1D)","is","an","autoimmune","disease","resulting","in","beta-cell","destruction","mediated","by","islet-infiltrating","leukocytes.","The","role","of","oxidative","stress","in","human","and","murine","models","of","T1D","is","highly","significant","as","these","noxious","molecules","contribute","to","diabetic","complications","and","beta-cell","destruction,","but","their","direct","impact","on","dysregulated","autoimmune","responses","is","highly","understudied.","Pro-inflammatory","macrophages","play","a","vital","role","in","the","initiation","and","effector","phases","of","T1D","by","producing","reactive","oxygen","species","and","pro-inflammatory","cytokines","to","facilitate","beta-cell","destruction","and","by","presenting","antigen","to","autoreactive","T","cells.","Recent","evidence","has","demonstrated","that","macrophage","differentiation","and","pro-inflammatory","innate","immune","responses","are","regulated","by","the","synthesis","of","free","radicals.","This","review","will","focus","on","the","synergistic","effects","of","free","radicals","on","macrophage","responses","in","T1D","and","provide","insight","that","redox","modulation","of","innate","immune","responses","may","be","an","effective","strategy","to","curtail","autoimmune","diabetes."],["Type","1","diabetes","(T1D)","autoimmune","disease","resulting","beta-cell","destruction","mediated","islet-infiltrating","leukocytes.","role","oxidative","stress","human","murine","models","T1D","highly","significant","noxious","molecules","contribute","diabetic","complications","beta-cell","destruction,","direct","impact","dysregulated","autoimmune","responses","highly","understudied.","Pro-inflammatory","macrophages","play","vital","role","initiation","effector","phases","T1D","producing","reactive","oxygen","species","pro-inflammatory","cytokines","facilitate","beta-cell","destruction","presenting","antigen","autoreactive","cells.","Recent","evidence","demonstrated","macrophage","differentiation","pro-inflammatory","innate","immune","responses","regulated","synthesis","free","radicals.","review","focus","synergistic","effects","free","radicals","macrophage","responses","T1D","provide","insight","redox","modulation","innate","immune","responses","may","effective","strategy","curtail","autoimmune","diabetes."],[0,300,[9,10,11,20,23,30,34,35,36,39,42,45,46,50,53,55,71,80,83,84,88,92,93,108,113,115,125,128,129,132,134,136,138,144,146,159,160,166,168,173,175,185,197,207,216,219,220,224,230,237,238,244,246,251,252,254,264,272,273,277,285,290,291,293],[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,1.0]],[0,300,[9,10,11,20,23,30,34,35,36,39,42,45,46,50,53,55,71,80,83,84,88,92,93,108,113,115,125,128,129,132,134,136,138,144,146,159,160,166,168,173,175,185,197,207,216,219,220,224,230,237,238,244,246,251,252,254,264,272,273,277,285,290,291,293],[1.0799410965294016,0.9627748498890563,1.0590726840946536,1.0154719451674472,1.6181451414000296,1.229293833954521,2.9203987812084398,1.5169759064063018,1.1536222836482644,0.8034198542151494,0.8464187394514634,1.1729232446853115,0.9374323630385122,2.752266501094881,0.8931898536438588,0.8289966960047991,1.1288422546497774,1.4650814182015282,0.9578511570272716,2.761312616444232,1.2580539861297835,3.8670986831638836,0.5682279643847652,2.7374673265304197,1.0428998248490526,2.1844497828231084,2.9366987899322887,1.3424163549478365,0.8561318400979634,0.9412896484382702,3.043295710416099,2.4254494685150885,1.4313973997005138,0.6830214611927826,2.0371971523337584,1.4472959857683119,1.252762968495368,1.5800834565379465,2.0392859253695708,1.0989892915000963,1.4452008949468815,1.3280894623270747,1.2076231325028917,1.2863006522510883,0.9807036169791469,2.780702732958512,0.9422562990693651,2.884999627009638,1.3041951421276388,0.7801242916116272,1.229293833954521,1.1126569302287599,1.2767961679395243,1.6143500704314782,0.9989597020949569,0.7825944451936896,0.7719342376415829,0.9278537457414425,2.0226365055975073,1.0667104735427713,4.066052278703431,5.112593732758151,2.8037384497226174,0.9786955841759014]],1.0],["Relationship of Glucose Variability With Glycated Hemoglobin and Daily Mean Glucose: A Post Hoc Analysis of Data From 5 Phase 3 Studies.",["Luo J","Qu Y","Zhang Q","Chang AM","Jacober SJ"],"J Diabetes Sci Technol. 2017 Oct 1:1932296817736315. doi: 10.1177/1932296817736315.","BACKGROUND: The association of glucose variability (GV) with other glycemic measures is emerging as a topic of interest. The aim of this analysis is to study the correlation between GV and measures of glycemic control, such as glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and daily mean glucose (DMG). METHODS: Data from 5 phase 3 trials were pooled into 3 analysis groups: type 2 diabetes (T2D) treated with basal insulin only, T2D treated with basal-bolus therapy, and type 1 diabetes (T1D). A generalized boosted model was used post hoc to assess the relationship of the following variables with glycemic control parameters (HbA1c and DMG): within-day GV, between-day GV (calculated using self-monitored blood glucose and fasting blood glucose [FBG]), hypoglycemia rate, and certain baseline characteristics. RESULTS: Within-day GV (calculated using standard deviation [SD]) was found to have a significant influence on endpoints HbA1c and DMG in all 3 patient groups. Between-day GV from FBG (calculated using SD), within-day GV (calculated using coefficient of variation), and hypoglycemia rate were found to significantly influence the endpoint HbA1c in the T2D basal-only group. CONCLUSIONS: Lower within-day GV was significantly associated with improvement in DMG and HbA1c. This finding suggests that GV could be a marker in the early phases of new antihyperglycemic therapy development for predicting clinical outcomes in terms of HbA1c and

S0168-8227(17)31032-X. doi: 10.1016/j.diabres.2017.10.011.","AIMS: To determine the relative risk of incident hip fracture in patients with type 1 diabetes and matched controls, to examine baseline associates of incident hip fracture in the patients with type 1 diabetes, and to compare hip fracture rates in age- and sex- matched patients with type 1 versus type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Longitudinal observational study of 121 adults with type 1 diabetes (mean+/-SD age 43.0+/-15.5 years, 59.5% male) and 484 age- and sex-matched adults without diabetes. Age and sex matching was possible for 93 pairs of type 1 and type 2 participants. The main outcome measure was incident hip fracture hospitalisation. RESULTS: During a mean+/-SD 14.5+/-5.8 years of follow-up, the incidence rate ratio for first hip fracture hospitalisation in FDS1 type 1 participants versus residents without diabetes was 6.39 (95% CI 1.94-22.35, P<0.001). In Cox proportional hazards modelling, type 1 diabetes was associated with cause-specific hazard ratio (csHR) for hip fracture of 7.11 (2.45-20.64, P<0.001) after age and sex adjustment. Hip fracture in type 1 participants was associated with older age, osteoporosis treatment, depressive symptoms, ethnicity, systolic blood pressure, serum HDL-cholesterol, albuminuria and serum adiponectin (P</=0.047); associations remained for the first three of these variables after adjustment for age and body mass index (P</=0.025). The csHR for incident hip fracture was 5.32 (1.12-25.37, P=0.036) for type 1 versus 2 diabetes.

tumors that arise from the epithelial cells of the bile ducts, and the etiology of both cancer types is poorly understood. Thus, we utilized the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare resource to examine risk factors and novel preexisting medical conditions that may be associated with these cancer types. METHODS: Between 2000 and 2011, 2,092 ICC and 2,981 ECC cases and 323,615 controls were identified using the SEER-Medicare database. Logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease was associated with approximately 3-fold increased risks of ICC (OR = 3.52, 95% CI: 2.87-4.32) and ECC (OR = 2.93, 95% CI: 2.42-3.55). Other metabolic conditions, including obesity and type 2 diabetes, were also associated with increased risks of both cancer types. Smoking was associated with a 46% and 77% increased ICC and ECC risk, respectively. Several autoimmune/inflammatory conditions, including type 1 diabetes and gout, were associated with increased risks of ICC/ECC. As anticipated, viral hepatitis, alcohol-related disorders, and bile duct conditions were associated with both cancer types. However, thyrotoxicosis and hemochromatosis were associated with an increased risk of ICC but not ECC, but did not remain significantly associated after Bonferroni correction. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, risk factors for ICC and ECC were similar, with the exceptions of thyrotoxicosis and hemochromatosis. Notably, metabolic conditions were associated with both cancer types.

Rev. 2017 Oct 19. doi: 10.1089/ten.TEB.2017.0311.","Pancreatic islet transplantation has been validated as a valuable therapy for type 1 diabetes mellitus patients with exhausted insulin treatment. However, this therapy remains limited by the shortage of donor and the requirement of lifelong immunosuppression. Islet encapsulation, as an available bioartificial pancreas (BAP), represents a promising approach to enable protecting islet grafts without or with minimal immunosuppression and possibly expanding the donor pool. In order to develop a clinically implantable BAP, some key aspects need to be taken into accounts: encapsulation material, capsule design and implantation site. Among them, implant site exerts an important influence on the engraftment, stability and biocompatibility of implanted BAP. Currently, an optimal site for encapsulated islet transplantation may include: sufficient capacity to host large graft volumes, portal drainage, ease of access using safe and reproducible procedure, adequate blood/oxygen supply, minimal immune/inflammatory reaction, pliable for noninvasive imaging and biopsy, and potential of local microenvironment manipulation or bioengineering. Varying degrees of success have been confirmed with the utilization of liver or extrahepatic sites in an experimental or preclinical setting.

with insulin. The aim of the present study was to investigate real-world incidence and predictors of hypoglycaemia in insulin-treated patients. METHODS: More than 300 consecutive patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes treated with insulin were enrolled during regular out-patient visits from 36 diabetes practices throughout the whole country. They completed a comprehensive questionnaire on hypoglycaemia knowledge, awareness, and incidence in the last month and last six months. In addition, in the prospective part, patients recorded incidence of hypoglycaemic events using a special diary prospectively on a daily basis, through 4 weeks. RESULTS: At least one hypoglycaemic event was self-reported in 84.1%, and 56.4% of patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, respectively, during the prospective period of 4 weeks. 43.4% and 26.2% of patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, respectively, experienced a nocturnal hypoglycaemic event. In the same time-period, severe hypoglycaemia was experienced by 15.9% and 7.1% of patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, respectively. Lower glycated haemoglobin was not a significant predictor of hypoglycaemia. CONCLUSIONS: Rates of self-reported hypoglycaemia in patients treated with insulin in the largest and most comprehensive study in Slovenia so far are higher than reported from randomised control trials, but comparable to data from observational studies. Hypoglycaemia incidence was high even with high glycated haemoglobin values.","type+1+diabetes",["INTRODUCTION:","Hypoglycaemia","is","the","major","barrier","for","glycaemic","target","achievement","in","patients","treated","with","insulin.","The","aim","of","the","present","study","was","to","investigate","real-world","incidence","and","predictors","of","hypoglycaemia","in","insulin-treated","patients.","METHODS:","More","than","300","consecutive","patients","with","type","1","or","type","2","diabetes","treated","with","insulin","were","enrolled","during","regular","out-patient","visits","from","36","diabetes","practices","throughout","the","whole","country.","They","completed","a","comprehensive","questionnaire","on","hypoglycaemia","knowledge,","awareness,","and","incidence","in","the","last","month","and","last","six","months.","In","addition,","in","the","prospective","part,","patients","recorded","incidence","of","hypoglycaemic","events","using","a","special","diary","prospectively","on","a","daily","basis,","through","4","weeks.","RESULTS:","At","least","one","hypoglycaemic","event","was","self-reported","in","84.1%,","and","56.4%","of","patients","with","type","1","and","type","2","diabetes,","respectively,","during","the","prospective","period","of","4","weeks.","43.4%","and","26.2%","of","patients","with","type","1","and","type","2","diabetes,","respectively,","experienced","a","nocturnal","hypoglycaemic","event.","In","the","same","time-period,","severe","hypoglycaemia","was","experienced","by","15.9%","and","7.1%","of","patients","with","type","1","and","type","2","diabetes,","respectively.","Lower","glycated","haemoglobin","was","not","a","significant","predictor","of","hypoglycaemia.","CONCLUSIONS:","Rates","of","self-reported","hypoglycaemia","in","patients","treated","with","insulin","in","the","largest","and","most","comprehensive","study","in","Slovenia","so","far","are","higher","than","reported","from","randomised","control","trials,","but","comparable","to","data","from","observational","studies.","Hypoglycaemia","incidence","was","high","even","with","high","glycated","haemoglobin","values."],["INTRODUCTION:","Hypoglycaemia","major","barrier","glycaemic","target","achievement","patients","treated","insulin.","aim","present","study","investigate","real-world","incidence","predictors","hypoglycaemia","insulin-treated","patients.","METHODS:","300","consecutive","patients","type","1","type","2","diabetes","treated","insulin","enrolled","regular","out-patient","visits","36","diabetes","practices","throughout","whole","country.","completed","comprehensive","questionnaire","hypoglycaemia","knowledge,","awareness,","incidence","last","month","last","six","months.","addition,","prospective","part,","patients","recorded","incidence","hypoglycaemic","events","using","special","diary","prospectively","daily","basis,","4","weeks.","RESULTS:","least","one","hypoglycaemic","event","self-reported","84.1%,","56.4%","patients","type","1","type","2","diabetes,","respectively,","prospective","period","4","weeks.","43.4%","26.2%","patients","type","1","type","2","diabetes,","respectively,","experienced","nocturnal","hypoglycaemic","event.","time-period,","severe","hypoglycaemia","experienced","15.9%","7.1%","patients","type","1","type","2","diabetes,","respectively.","Lower","glycated","haemoglobin","significant","predictor","hypoglycaemia.","CONCLUSIONS:","Rates","self-reported","hypoglycaemia","patients","treated","insulin","largest","comprehensive","study","Slovenia","far","higher","reported","randomised","control","trials,","comparable","data","observational","studies.","Hypoglycaemia","incidence","high","even","high","glycated","haemoglobin","values."],[0,300,[1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,21,22,24,25,26,28,36,39,49,55,57,59,60,61,62,64,65,66,68,70,71,73,76,86,89,93,94,95,104,105,106,107,109,113,115,117,122,124,127,130,132,139,144,149,151,154,157,158,160,162,172,174,180,189,200,203,204,206,207,215,216,222,231,232,237,247,248,250,252,254,256,257,258,261,268,270,284,285,288,289,290,293,295],[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,8.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]],[0,300,[1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,21,22,24,25,26,28,36,39,49,55,57,59,60,61,62,64,65,66,68,70,71,73,76,86,89,93,94,95,104,105,106,107,109,113,115,117,122,124,127,130,132,139,144,149,151,154,157,158,160,162,172,174,180,189,200,203,204,206,207,215,216,222,231,232,237,247,248,250,252,254,256,257,258,261,268,270,284,285,288,289,290,293,295],[0.895956107136749,1.2152181057203364,1.2687207539339787,1.4173016299001202,1.7478814630560007,1.0010088831398924,0.94710361830369,1.0799410965294016,2.8883245496671686,1.4080136374336496,1.158412711970897,0.9927122369619654,1.8291919515915835,7.086802969246505,1.1288422546497774,1.1536222836482644,1.6068

Managing T2DM and its associated complications in individual patient consultations poses substantial challenges to physicians due to limited time and resources and lack of access to multidisciplinary teams. Shared medical appointments (SMAs) are consecutive medical consultations provided by a physician in a group setting, where integrated medical care and patient education are delivered in a single session. SMAs allow physicians to deliver the same level of care to multiple patients at the same time, thereby maximizing available resources. However, the effectiveness and practicality of SMAs in the management of T2DM remains unknown. This narrative review summarizes current and emerging evidence regarding the effectiveness of SMAs in improving clinical outcomes in patients with T2DM, as well as whether SMAs are associated with reduced costs and improved diabetes-related behavioral and lifestyle changes. An extensive literature search was conducted on major electronic databases including PubMed and Google Scholar using keywords, including SMAs, group visits, and T2DM to identify all studies of SMAs in patients with T2DM. Studies in type 1 diabetes or mixed or unspecified populations were excluded, as well as studies where SMAs did not involve a physician since these do not meet the classical definition of a SMA. Nineteen studies were identified and are included in this review. Overall, current evidence suggests that SMAs delivered regularly over time may be effective in improving glycemic outcomes, diabetes knowledge, and some diabetes-related behaviors. However, the main limitation of existing studies was the paucity of comparisons with standard care which limits the ability to draw conclusions regarding whether SMAs are superior to standard care in T2DM management. Moreover, the small number of studies and substantial heterogeneity in study designs, populations, and interventions creates difficulties in establishing the practicality and efficiency of SMAs in the clinical care setting. We conclude that there remains a need for larger studies to identify populations who may or may not benefit from the SMA model of care and to clarify the potential benefits and barriers to implementing SMAs into routine diabetes care.","type+1+diabetes",["Type","2","diabetes","mellitus","(T2DM)","is","a","complex","chronic","disease","affecting","over","400","million","people","worldwide.","Managing","T2DM","and","its","associated","complications","in","individual","patient","consultations","poses","substantial","challenges","to","physicians","due","to","limited","time","and","resources","and","lack","of","access","to","multidisciplinary","teams.","Shared","medical","appointments","(SMAs)","are","consecutive","medical","consultations","provided","by","a","physician","in","a","group","setting,","where","integrated","medical","care","and","patient","education","are","delivered","in","a","single","session.","SMAs","allow","physicians","to","deliver","the","same","level","of","care","to","multiple","patients","at","the","same","time,","thereby","maximizing","available","resources.","However,","the","effectiveness","and","practicality","of","SMAs","in","the","management","of","T2DM","remains","unknown.","This","narrative","review","summarizes","current","and","emerging","evidence","regarding","the","effectiveness","of","SMAs","in","improving","clinical","outcomes","in","patients","with","T2DM,","as","well","as","whether","SMAs","are","associated","with","reduced","costs","and","improved","diabetes-related","behavioral","and","lifestyle","changes.","An","extensive","literature","search","was","conducted","on","major","electronic","databases","including","PubMed","and","Google","Scholar","using","keywords,","including","SMAs,","group","visits,","and","T2DM","to","identify","all","studies","of","SMAs","in","patients","with","T2DM.","Studies","in","type","1","diabetes","or","mixed","or","unspecified","populations","were","excluded,","as","well","as","studies","where","SMAs","did","not","involve","a","physician","since","these","do","not","meet","the","classical","definition","of","a","SMA.","Nineteen","studies","were","identified","and","are","included","in","this","review.","Overall,","current","evidence","suggests","that","SMAs","delivered","regularly","over","time","may","be","effective","in","improving","glycemic","outcomes,","diabetes","knowledge,","and","some","diabetes-related","behaviors.","However,","the","main","limitation","of","existing","studies","was","the","paucity","of","comparisons","with","standard","care","which","limits","the","ability","to","draw","conclusions","regarding","whether","SMAs","are","superior","to","standard","care","in","T2DM","management.","Moreover,","the","small","number","of","studies","and","substantial","heterogeneity","in","study","designs,","populations,","and","interventions","creates","difficulties","in","establishing","the","practicality","and","efficiency","of","SMAs","in","the","clinical","care","setting.","We","conclude","that","there","remains","a","need","for","larger","studies","to","identify","populations","who","may","or","may","not","benefit","from","the","SMA","model","of","care","and","to","clarify","the","potential","benefits","and","barriers","to","implementing","SMAs","into","routine","diabetes","care."],["Type","2","diabetes","mellitus","(T2DM)","complex","chronic","disease","affecting","400","million","people","worldwide.","Managing","T2DM","associated","complications","individual","patient","consultations","poses","substantial","challenges","physicians","due","limited","time","resources","lack","access","multidisciplinary","teams.","Shared","medical","appointments","(SMAs)","consecutive","medical","consultations","provided","physician","group","setting,","integrated","medical","care","patient","education","delivered","single","session.","SMAs","allow","physicians","deliver","level","care","multiple","patients","time,","thereby","maximizing","available","resources.","However,","effectiveness","practicality","SMAs","management","T2DM","remains","unknown.","narrative","review","summarizes","current","emerging","evidence","regarding","effectiveness","SMAs","improving","clinical","outcomes","patients","T2DM,","well","whether","SMAs","associated","reduced","costs","improved","diabetes-related","behavioral","lifestyle","changes.","extensive","literature","search","conducted","major","electronic","databases","including","PubMed","Google","Scholar","using","keywords,","including","SMAs,","group","visits,","T2DM","identify","studies","SMAs","patients","T2DM.","Studies","type","1","diabetes","mixed","unspecified","populations","excluded,","well","studies","SMAs","involve","physician","since","meet","classical","definition","SMA.","Nineteen","studies","identified","included","review.","Overall,","current","evidence","suggests","SMAs","delivered","regularly","time","may","effective","improving","glycemic","outcomes,","diabetes","knowledge,","diabetes-related","behaviors.","However,","main","limitation","existing","studies","paucity","comparisons","standard","care","limits","ability","draw","conclusions","regarding","whether","SMAs","superior","standard","care","T2DM","management.","Moreover,

mellitus (T2DM). Using an insulin-independent mechanism (glycosuria), they reduce glucose toxicity and improve insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function. The promising results obtained in clinical trials show that SGLT2 significantly improves glycemic control and provides greater cardiovascular protection, combined with a reduction in body weight and blood pressure (BP). This review focuses on ertugliflozin, a new, highly selective, and reversible SGLT2 inhibitor. Clinical trials published to date show that ertugliflozin, both as a monotherapy and as an add-on to oral antidiabetic agents, is safe and effective in reducing glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), body weight, and BP in T2DM patients.","type+1+diabetes",["Sodium-glucose","cotransporter","2","(SGLT2)","inhibitors","are","the","latest","therapeutic","strategy","in","the","treatment","of","type","2","diabetes","mellitus","(T2DM).","Using","an","insulin-independent","mechanism","(glycosuria),","they","reduce","glucose","toxicity","and","improve","insulin","sensitivity","and","beta-cell","function.","The","promising","results","obtained","in","clinical","trials","show","that","SGLT2","significantly","improves","glycemic","control","and","provides","greater","cardiovascular","protection,","combined","with","a","reduction","in","body","weight","and","blood","pressure","(BP).","This","review","focuses","on","ertugliflozin,","a","new,","highly","selective,","and","reversible","SGLT2","inhibitor.","Clinical","trials","published","to","date","show","that","ertugliflozin,","both","as","a","monotherapy","and","as","an","add-on","to","oral","antidiabetic","agents,","is","safe","and","effective","in","reducing","glycosylated","hemoglobin","(HbA1c),","body","weight,","and","BP","in","T2DM","patients."],["Sodium-glucose","cotransporter","2","(SGLT2)","inhibitors","latest","therapeutic","strategy","treatment","type","2","diabetes","mellitus","(T2DM).","Using","insulin-independent","mechanism","(glycosuria),","reduce","glucose","toxicity","improve","insulin","sensitivity","beta-cell","function.","promising","results","obtained","clinical","trials","show","SGLT2","significantly","improves","glycemic","control","provides","greater","cardiovascular","protection,","combined","reduction","body","weight","blood","pressure","(BP).","review","focuses","ertugliflozin,","new,","highly","selective,","reversible","SGLT2","inhibitor.","Clinical","trials","published","date","show","ertugliflozin,","monotherapy","add-on","oral","antidiabetic","agents,","safe","effective","reducing","glycosylated","hemoglobin","(HbA1c),","body","weight,","BP","T2DM","patients."],[0,300,[1,2,3,11,12,15,26,30,39,41,42,45,63,69,70,77,86,89,90,92,106,108,109,115,116,124,128,129,130,135,148,149,154,161,164,165,168,172,174,179,189,197,202,204,210,212,214,215,218,219,222,225,232,235,242,244,248,255,263,268,269,277,280,289,291,297,298],[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]],[0,300,[1,2,3,11,12,15,26,30,39,41,42,45,63,69,70,77,86,89,90,92,106,108,109,115,116,124,128,129,130,135,148,149,154,161,164,165,168,172,174,179,189,197,202,204,210,212,214,215,218,219,222,225,232,235,242,244,248,255,263,268,269,277,280,289,291,297,298],[0.895956107136749,1.2152181057203364,2.5374415078679573,1.0590726840946536,1.1656416591140484,1.6034755360643291,0.8858503711558131,1.229293833954521,1.6068397084302988,3.213303779880782,0.8464187394514634,1.1729232446853115,0.8803808953512776,2.6167410270762383,1.0777238007207541,1.386671363951877,1.3195908276056123,2.4637489610960253,1.0040905496773007,2.5780657887759224,1.5789975517157584,1.3687336632652098,1.0196429626847854,1.0922248914115542,0.7743842184505674,1.4831889088289185,1.3424163549478365,0.8561318400979634,1.10238872820156,1.3702162432254326,1.1524282536556567,1.032261426643997,1.5343073627579418,1.216489561708533,1.1080802632013482,1.2767961679395243,1.0196429626847854,0.8722323667873726,1.1230316630543118,1.7719790146350614,1.0092478586844453,1.2076231325028917,1.5118345069058832,2.380245371735582,1.162020653347096,0.9183660085363332,1.349657516204396,1.1668515806167616,1.8348443340632539,1.8538018219723413,1.1512356476705334,1.0821633196661193,1.1668515806167616,1.6569096848502742,1.1149531424891101,1.1126569302287599,0.8950331721381481,1.5238724854653622,0.9578511570272716,2.045565365378906,1.4683493949661444,1.0667104735427713,1.1172546394773895,0.7719342376415829,1.4018692248613087,1.206362892890604,1.6951822310551499]],1.0],["The Role of Authoritative Parenting in Adolescent Type 1 Diabetes Management.",["Radcliff Z","Weaver P","Chen R","Streisand R","Holmes C"],"J Pediatr Psychol. 2017 Aug 17. doi: 10.1093/jpepsy/jsx107.","Objective: Adolescents with Type 1 diabetes are at risk for poorer adherence, lower quality of life (QOL), and poorer glycemic control (HbA1c). Authoritative parenting (AP) along with youth adherence and QOL was hypothesized to relate to better HbA1c. Parent-youth dyads ( N = 257) completed baseline measures of adherence and QOL. Youth completed an AP questionnaire, and HbA1c samples were evaluated. Structural equation modeling determined relations among AP, adherence, QOL, and glycemic control. AP indirectly linked to better HbA1c (beta = -.15, p = .021) through both better adherence and higher QOL. AP also was associated directly with better adherence (beta = .26, p = .001), which in turn was linked to better HbA1c (beta = -.35, p = .021). In addition, adherence was associated directly with QOL (beta = -.56, p = .001). Together, better youth adherence and higher QOL are two mechanisms by which more AP indirectly relates to better glycemic control during the early adolescent

J"],"Diabetes Technol Ther. 2017 Oct 13. doi: 10.1089/dia.2017.0235.","BACKGROUND: While the number of diabetes-specific mobile applications (apps) continues to grow, there is a lack of knowledge about their actual use. METHODS: The second MILES (Management and Impact for Long-term Empowerment and Success)-Australia study was a national cross-sectional survey of the psychological, behavioral, and social aspects of diabetes for adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Associations between diabetes-specific app usage and demographic, clinical, and psychosocial variables were examined. RESULTS: Of the 1589 respondents responding to the diabetes-specific app questions, 795 had T1D (mean +/- standard deviation age 43 +/- 14 years; 61% women; diabetes duration 19 +/- 14 years) and 794 had T2D (age 60 +/- 9 years; 40% women; diabetes duration 11 +/- 7 years). Among adults with T1D, 24% (n = 188) reported using apps, with carbohydrate counting (74%; n = 139) as the most common cited purpose. App usage was significantly associated with shorter diabetes duration, more frequent glucose monitoring, and lower self-reported HbA1c. Among adults with T2D, 8% (n = 64) reported using apps, with glucose monitoring (62%; n = 39) as the most common purpose. For all respondents, the most commonly reported reason for not using apps was a belief that they could not help with diabetes self-management. CONCLUSIONS: A minority of adults with T1D and T2D use apps to support their self-management.

S1570-677X(17)30057-6. doi: 10.1016/j.ehb.2017.09.002.","Poor health is widely recognized as a consequence of social disadvantage, but health problems may also help transmit social disadvantage over time and generations. Experimentally assigned health exposures, namely those tested in randomized controlled trials, may provide opportunities to estimate the causal effects of health on socioeconomic status (SES). We revisit data from the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial, a randomized controlled trial of glucose control therapy in Type 1 diabetic patients, and use treatment assignment as an instrument for health status to test the causal effect of treatment-related health improvement on subsequent SES measured during the trial's follow-up study, the Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications study. We used the Two-Factor Hollingshead Index of Social Position, which comprises education and occupation, to measure SES. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) served as a proxy for health status. Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models showed that lower HbA1c at the trial's end was associated with higher SES at both the start of the follow-up and 17 years later. However, instrumental variable analyses showed no causal effect of HbA1c on SES, suggesting that OLS estimates are biased by endogeneity. Sensitivity analyses showed robustness to several alternate specifications. While the HbA1c advantage conferred by random assignment to treatment within the trial did not produce higher Hollingshead Index scores, we note that occupation and education categories may be harder to affect than are outcomes such as income.

effects of add-on exenatide to insulin on glycemic variability and hypoglycemia in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.",["Jiang LL","Wang SQ","Ding B","Zhu J","Jing T","Ye L","Lee KO","Wu JD","Ma JH"],"J Endocrinol Invest. 2017 Oct 14. doi: 10.1007/s40618-017-0765-0.","OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of add-on exenatide to insulin on glycemic excursion and the counter-regulatory hormone in response to hypoglycemia in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). METHODS: 30 patients with T1DM were recruited and randomly assigned to exenatide + insulin-treated group (group 1, n = 15) or insulin-only-treated group (group 2, n = 15) for 4 weeks. All patients had continuous glucose monitor system (CGMS) applied at before (week-0) and after (week-4) treatment to evaluate the glycemic variability. All patients had an arginine-stimulated test at before and after treatment. Six patients from each group also had hypoglycemic clamp test to assess counter-regulatory hormone level. RESULTS: Patients in the exenatide group had significant reductions in body weight, body mass index (BMI), total insulin dose, bolus insulin dose, fructosamine, and glycemic excursion after 4 weeks' treatment. Compared with patients in group 2, the mean amplitude of glycemic excursion (MAGE) and coefficient of variation (CV) of exenatide group decreased significantly. Similarly, a significant decrease of glucagon (GLC) in the arginine-stimulated test was found in group 1. No significant changes of GLC, growth hormone (GH), cortisol (COR), epinephrine (E), and norepinephrine (NE) were found in both groups during hypoglycemia clamp test. However, patients who had residual islet function in group 1 showed an upward trend of basic C-peptide (C-P) and GLC during the hypoglycemia period. CONCLUSION: Although exenatide could inhibit glucagon secretion during euglycemia or hyperglycemia in patients with T1DM, it has no effect on GLC and counter-regulatory hormones during hypoglycemia

disputed association between HbA1c and severe hypoglycemia. METHODS: 52 Patients with T1D and IAH participated in an earlier reported randomized, crossover trial with two 16-week intervention periods comparing continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) with self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG). In this previous study, time spent in normoglycemia (the primary outcome), was improved by 9.6% (p<0.0001). We performed post-hoc analyses using a zero-inflated Poisson regression model to assess the relationship between severe hypoglycemia and HbA1c, glucose variability and duration of diabetes. RESULTS: During SMBG use, HbA1c and the number of severe hypoglycemic events were negatively associated (OR 0.20 [95% CI 0.09 to 0.44]). During CGM use, this relationship showed an odds ratio of 0.65 (95% CI 0.42 to 1.01). There was no significant relationship between glucose variability or duration of diabetes and severe hypoglycemia. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with T1D and IAH, treated with standard SMBG, a negative association exists between HbA1c and the number of severe hypoglycemic events. Thus, reaching target HbA1c values still comes with a higher risk of severe hypoglycemia.

maintenance of pancreatic beta cells through a fine-tuned regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis. TCF19 also exhibits genomic association with type 2 diabetes, although the precise molecular mechanism remains unknown. It harbours both a plant homeodomain (PHD) and a forkhead-associated domain (FHA) implicated in epigenetic recognition and gene regulation, a phenomenon that has remained unexplored. Here, we show that TCF19 selectively interacts with histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4Me3) through its PHD finger. Knocking down TCF19 under high glucose condition affected many metabolic processes, including gluconeogenesis. We found that TCF19 overexpression represses de novo glucose production in HepG2 cells. The transcriptional repression of key genes, induced by TCF19 coincided with NuRD (nucleosome-remodeling-deacetylase) complex recruitment to the promoters of these genes. TCF19 interacted with chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 4 (CHD4), which is a part of the NuRD complex, in a glucose concentration independent manner. In summary, our results show that TCF19 interacts with an active transcription mark and recruits a co-repressor complex to regulate gluconeogenic gene expression in HepG2 cells. Our study offers critical insights into the molecular mechanisms of transcriptional regulation of gluconeogenesis and into the roles of chromatin readers in metabolic homeostasis.","type+1+diabetes",["Transcription","Factor","19","(TCF19)","has","been","reported","as","type","1","diabetes","associated","locus","involved","in","maintenance","of","pancreatic","beta","cells","through","a","fine-tuned","regulation","of","cell","proliferation","and","apoptosis.","TCF19","also","exhibits","genomic","association","with","type","2","diabetes,","although","the","precise","molecular","mechanism","remains","unknown.","It","harbours","both","a","plant","homeodomain","(PHD)","and","a","forkhead-associated","domain","(FHA)","implicated","in","epigenetic","recognition","and","gene","regulation,","a","phenomenon","that","has","remained","unexplored.","Here,","we","show","that","TCF19","selectively","interacts","with","histone","3","lysine","4","trimethylation","(H3K4Me3)","through","its","PHD","finger.","Knocking","down","TCF19","under","high","glucose","condition","affected","many","metabolic","processes,","including","gluconeogenesis.","We","found","that","TCF19","overexpression","represses","de","novo","glucose","production","in","HepG2","cells.","The","transcriptional","repression","of","key","genes,","induced","by","TCF19","coincided","with","NuRD","(nucleosome-remodeling-deacetylase)","complex","recruitment","to","the","promoters","of","these","genes.","TCF19","interacted","with","chromodomain","helicase","DNA-binding","protein","4","(CHD4),","which","is","a","part","of","the","NuRD","complex,","in","a","glucose","concentration","independent","manner.","In","summary,","our","results","show","that","TCF19","interacts","with","an","active","transcription","mark","and","recruits","a","co-repressor","complex","to","regulate","gluconeogenic","gene","expression","in","HepG2","cells.","Our","study","offers","critical","insights","into","the","molecular","mechanisms","of","transcriptional","regulation","of","gluconeogenesis","and","into","the","roles","of","chromatin","readers","in","metabolic","homeostasis."],["Transcription","Factor","19","(TCF19)","reported","type","1","diabetes","associated","locus","involved","maintenance","pancreatic","beta","cells","fine-tuned","regulation","cell","proliferation","apoptosis.","TCF19","also","exhibits","genomic","association","type","2","diabetes,","although","precise","molecular","mechanism","remains","unknown.","harbours","plant","homeodomain","(PHD)","forkhead-associated","domain","(FHA)","implicated","epigenetic","recognition","gene","regulation,","phenomenon","remained","unexplored.","Here,","show","TCF19","selectively","interacts","histone","3","lysine","4","trimethylation","(H3K4Me3)","PHD","finger.","Knocking","TCF19","high","glucose","condition","affected","many","metabolic","processes,","including","gluconeogenesis.","found","TCF19","overexpression","represses","de","novo","glucose","production","HepG2","cells.","transcriptional","repression","key","genes,","induced","TCF19","coincided","NuRD","(nucleosome-remodeling-deacetylase)","complex","recruitment","promoters","genes.","TCF19","interacted","chromodomain","helicase","DNA-binding","protein","4","(CHD4),","part","NuRD","complex,","glucose","concentration","independent","manner.","summary,","results","show","TCF19","interacts","active","transcription","mark","recruits","co-repressor","complex","regulate","gluconeogenic","gene","expression","HepG2","cells.","study","offers","critical","insights","molecular","mechanisms","transcriptional","regulation","gluconeogenesis","roles","chromatin","readers","metabolic","homeostasis."],[0,300,[2,4,8,10,12,17,18,20,23,26,31,33,39,40,42,45,49,55,60,63,66,69,71,73,76,81,82,88,89,91,94,95,97,99,100,101,104,113,114,115,118,123,125,130,142,144,146,149,151,152,153,155,156,157,160,169,172,190,191,192,194,197,201,203,204,205,206,207,208,209,213,215,216,219,220,221,224,226,229,240,241,243,247,254,256,261,262,264,265,267,270,275,279,285,288,289,290,291,293],[1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]],[0,300,[2,4,8,10,12,17,18,20,23,26,31,33,39,40,42,45,49,55,60,63,66,69,71,73,76,81,82,88,89,91,94,95,97,99,100,101,104,113,114,115,118,123,125,130,142,144,146,149,151,152,153,155,156,157,160,169,172,190,191,192,194,197,201,203,204,205,206,207,208,209,213,215,216,219,220,221,224,226,229,240,241,243,247,254,256,261,262,264,265,267,270,275,279,285,288,289,290,291,293],[1.2152181057203364,1.4173016299001202,2.84131085491107,0.9627748498890563,1.1656416591140484,1.0525721194915603,1.229293833954521,2.0309438903348944,3.2362902828000593,2.657551113467439,1.4618240863312217,1.195091640190978,0.8034198542151494,1.0154719451674472,0.8464187394514634,1.1729232446853115,1.1431203801211496,0.8289966960047991,2.0857996496981053,

important role as APC-expanding autoreactive T cell responses ultimately causing type 1 diabetes (T1D). Currently, humans at high future T1D risk can only be identified at late prodromal stages of disease indicated by markers such as insulin autoantibodies. When commenced in already insulin autoantibody+ NOD mice, continuous BAFFR-Fc treatment alone or in combination with anti-CD20 (designated combo therapy) inhibited T1D development. Despite eliciting broader B lymphocyte depletion, continuous combo therapy afforded no greater T1D protection than did BAFFR-Fc alone. As previously observed, late disease stage-initiated anti-CD20 monotherapy did not inhibit T1D, and in this study was additionally found to be associated with development of drug-blocking Abs. Promisingly, NOD mice given transient late disease stage BAFFR-Fc monotherapy were rendered T1D resistant. However, combo treatment abrogated the protective effect of transient BAFFR-Fc monotherapy. NOD mice receiving transient BAFF blockade were characterized by an enrichment of regulatory B lymphocytes that inhibit T1D development through IL-10 production, but this population is sensitive to deletion by anti-CD20 treatment. B lymphocytes from transient BAFFR-Fc-treated mice suppressed T cell proliferation to a greater extent than did those from controls. Proportions of B lymphocytes expressing CD73, an ecto-enzyme operating in a pathway converting proinflammatory ATP to anti-inflammatory adenosine, were also temporarily increased by transient BAFFR-Fc treatment, but not anti-CD20 therapy. These collective studies indicate transient BAFFR-Fc-mediated B lymphocyte depletion elicits long-term T1D protection by enriching regulatory B lymphocytes that are deleted by anti-CD20 cotherapy.","type+1+diabetes",["In","NOD","mice","and","also","likely","humans,","B","lymphocytes","play","an","important","role","as","APC-expanding","autoreactive","T","cell","responses","ultimately","causing","type","1","diabetes","(T1D).","Currently,","humans","at","high","future","T1D","risk","can","only","be","identified","at","late","prodromal","stages","of","disease","indicated","by","markers","such","as","insulin","autoantibodies.","When","commenced","in","already","insulin","autoantibody+","NOD","mice,","continuous","BAFFR-Fc","treatment","alone","or","in","combination","with","anti-CD20","(designated","combo","therapy)","inhibited","T1D","development.","Despite","eliciting","broader","B","lymphocyte","depletion,","continuous","combo","therapy","afforded","no","greater","T1D","protection","than","did","BAFFR-Fc","alone.","As","previously","observed,","late","disease","stage-initiated","anti-CD20","monotherapy","did","not","inhibit","T1D,","and","in","this","study","was","additionally","found","to","be","associated","with","development","of","drug-blocking","Abs.","Promisingly,","NOD","mice","given","transient","late","disease","stage","BAFFR-Fc","monotherapy","were","rendered","T1D","resistant.","However,","combo","treatment","abrogated","the","protective","effect","of","transient","BAFFR-Fc","monotherapy.","NOD","mice","receiving","transient","BAFF","blockade","were","characterized","by","an","enrichment","of","regulatory","B","lymphocytes","that","inhibit","T1D","development","through","IL-10","production,","but","this","population","is","sensitive","to","deletion","by","anti-CD20","treatment.","B","lymphocytes","from","transient","BAFFR-Fc-treated","mice","suppressed","T","cell","proliferation","to","a","greater","extent","than","did","those","from","controls.","Proportions","of","B","lymphocytes","expressing","CD73,","an","ecto-enzyme","operating","in","a","pathway","converting","proinflammatory","ATP","to","anti-inflammatory","adenosine,","were","also","temporarily","increased","by","transient","BAFFR-Fc","treatment,","but","not","anti-CD20","therapy.","These","collective","studies","indicate","transient","BAFFR-Fc-mediated","B","lymphocyte","depletion","elicits","long-term","T1D","protection","by","enriching","regulatory","B","lymphocytes","that","are","deleted","by","anti-CD20","cotherapy."],["NOD","mice","also","likely","humans,","B","lymphocytes","play","important","role","APC-expanding","autoreactive","cell","responses","ultimately","causing","type","1","diabetes","(T1D).","Currently,","humans","high","future","T1D","risk","identified","late","prodromal","stages","disease","indicated","markers","insulin","autoantibodies.","commenced","already","insulin","autoantibody+","NOD","mice,","continuous","BAFFR-Fc","treatment","alone","combination","anti-CD20","(designated","combo","therapy)","inhibited","T1D","development.","Despite","eliciting","broader","B","lymphocyte","depletion,","continuous","combo","therapy","afforded","greater","T1D","protection","BAFFR-Fc","alone.","previously","observed,","late","disease","stage-initiated","anti-CD20","monotherapy","inhibit","T1D,","study","additionally","found","associated","development","drug-blocking","Abs.","Promisingly,","NOD","mice","given","transient","late","disease","stage","BAFFR-Fc","monotherapy","rendered","T1D","resistant.","However,","combo","treatment","abrogated","protective","effect","transient","BAFFR-Fc","monotherapy.","NOD","mice","receiving","transient","BAFF","blockade","characterized","enrichment","regulatory","B","lymphocytes","inhibit","T1D","development","IL-10","production,","population","sensitive","deletion","anti-CD20","treatment.","B","lymphocytes","transient","BAFFR-Fc-treated","mice","suppressed","cell","proliferation","greater","extent","controls.","Proportions","B","lymphocytes","expressing","CD73,","ecto-enzyme","operating","pathway","converting","proinflammatory","ATP","anti-inflammatory","adenosine,","also","temporarily","increased","transient","BAFFR-Fc","treatment,","anti-CD20","therapy.","collective","studies","indicate","transient","BAFFR-Fc-mediated","B","lymphocyte","depletion","elicits","long-term","T1D","protection","enriching","regulatory","B","lymphocytes","deleted","anti-CD20","cotherapy."],[0,300,[0,2,6,9,10,15,22,26,27,28,31,34,35,36,39,42,44,46,49,50,55,56,57,62,64,65,67,72,73,76,79,80,91,93,94,98,99,102,104,105,106,107,115,120,123,126,127,129,133,134,139,143,144,149,151,154,155,156,163,167,173,175,177,179,180,183,185,186,189,192,197,198,201,204,209,211,213,214,215,216,218,222,225,231,236,237,238,243,245,249,252,253,256,257,260,264,268,269,278,283,285,288,290,294,296,297],[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.

environment. Now, emerging evidence suggests that pancreatic-resident forkhead box P3+ Tregs have distinguishable effects on the suppression of over-exuberant immune responses in autoimmune type 1 diabetes (T1D). Thus, there is growing interest in elucidating the role of pancreatic-resident Tregs that function and evolve in the local environment. In this review, we discuss the phenotype and function of Tregs residing in pancreatic tissues and pancreatic lymph nodes, with emphasis on the unique subpopulations of Tregs that control the disease progression in the context of T1D. Specifically, we discuss known and possible modulators that influence the survival, migration, and maintenance of pancreatic Tregs.","type+1+diabetes",["Recent","progress","in","regulatory","T","cells","(Tregs)","biology","emphasizes","the","importance","of","understanding","tissue-resident","Tregs","in","response","to","tissue-specific","environment.","Now,","emerging","evidence","suggests","that","pancreatic-resident","forkhead","box","P3+","Tregs","have","distinguishable","effects","on","the","suppression","of","over-exuberant","immune","responses","in","autoimmune","type","1","diabetes","(T1D).","Thus,","there","is","growing","interest","in","elucidating","the","role","of","pancreatic-resident","Tregs","that","function","and","evolve","in","the","local","environment.","In","this","review,","we","discuss","the","phenotype","and","function","of","Tregs","residing","in","pancreatic","tissues","and","pancreatic","lymph","nodes,","with","emphasis","on","the","unique","subpopulations","of","Tregs","that","control","the","disease","progression","in","the","context","of","T1D.","Specifically,","we","discuss","known","and","possible","modulators","that","influence","the","survival,","migration,","and","maintenance","of","pancreatic","Tregs."],["Recent","progress","regulatory","cells","(Tregs)","biology","emphasizes","importance","understanding","tissue-resident","Tregs","response","tissue-specific","environment.","Now,","emerging","evidence","suggests","pancreatic-resident","forkhead","box","P3+","Tregs","distinguishable","effects","suppression","over-exuberant","immune","responses","autoimmune","type","1","diabetes","(T1D).","Thus,","growing","interest","elucidating","role","pancreatic-resident","Tregs","function","evolve","local","environment.","review,","discuss","phenotype","function","Tregs","residing","pancreatic","tissues","pancreatic","lymph","nodes,","emphasis","unique","subpopulations","Tregs","control","disease","progression","context","T1D.","Specifically,","discuss","known","possible","modulators","influence","survival,","migration,","maintenance","pancreatic","Tregs."],[0,300,[0,6,8,12,13,21,24,26,33,39,41,45,50,53,55,64,70,71,74,80,100,101,109,111,112,116,127,130,134,135,136,144,148,159,161,164,170,172,173,174,175,189,198,213,214,217,219,224,236,237,254,258,264,266,272,273,274,277,284,285],[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0]],[0,300,[0,6,8,12,13,21,24,26,33,39,41,45,50,53,55,64,70,71,74,80,100,101,109,111,112,116,127,130,134,135,136,144,148,159,161,164,170,172,173,174,175,189,198,213,214,217,219,224,236,237,254,258,264,266,272,273,274,277,284,285],[1.229293833954521,1.0010088831398924,0.94710361830369,1.1656416591140484,0.9827156900925671,1.4080136374336496,0.4963561184809827,1.7717007423116262,1.195091640190978,0.8034198542151494,1.0711012599602607,1.1729232446853115,0.9174221670316269,0.8931898536438588,0.8289966960047991,0.8333238338686806,1.0777238007207541,1.1288422546497774,1.219037333787332,1.4650814182015282,1.0375664788736902,1.315368442725764,1.0196429626847854,1.5169759064063018,1.4034017922110866,0.7743842184505674,1.3540275158755144,3.3071661846046805,2.028863806944066,1.3702162432254326,0.8084831561716962,0.6830214611927826,1.1524282536556567,1.4472959857683119,1.216489561708533,1.1080802632013482,1.452115272204261,2.616697100362118,1.0989892915000963,1.1230316630543118,0.7226004474734408,4.036991434737781,1.376168641752728,3.033954758396261,1.349657516204396,1.3083705135381192,0.9269009109861707,1.442499813504819,1.08327628583554,0.7801242916116272,0.7825944451936896,1.34386039852007,0.7719342376415829,1.575347912628209,0.9278537457414425,2.0226365055975073,1.2076231325028917,5.333552367713857,1.3525687264118544,1.0165130696758577]],1.0],["Using LSTMs to learn physiological models of blood glucose behavior.",["Mirshekarian S","Bunescu R","Marling C","Schwartz F"],"Conf Proc IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc. 2017 Jul;2017:2887-2891. doi: 10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037460.","For people with type 1 diabetes, good blood glucose control is essential to keeping serious disease complications at bay. This entails carefully monitoring blood glucose levels and taking corrective steps whenever they are too high or too low. If blood glucose levels could be accurately predicted, patients could take proactive steps to prevent blood glucose excursions from occurring. However, accurate predictions require complex physiological models of blood glucose behavior. Factors such as insulin boluses, carbohydrate intake, and exercise influence blood glucose in ways that are difficult to capture through manually engineered equations. In this paper, we describe a recursive neural network (RNN) approach that uses long short-term memory (LSTM) units to learn a physiological model of blood glucose. When trained on raw data from real patients, the LSTM networks (LSTMs) obtain results that are competitive with a previous state-of-the-art model based on manually engineered physiological equations. The RNN approach can incorporate arbitrary physiological parameters without the need for sophisticated manual engineering, thus holding the promise of further improvements in prediction

10.4274/balkanmedj.2016.1415.","BACKGROUND: Today, more than 90% of adolescents with chronic conditions are surviving into adulthood and move pediatric to adult care with their chronic illness. It is important to gain autonomy and ensure readiness for adolescents/ young adults to use the adult health care system prior to the transfer of care. However, the lack of the transition readiness assessment tool which is validated, patient-centered and appropriate to developmental differences in pediatric care is seen a major obstacle for transition of care from pediatric to adult services. AIMS: The aim of this study is examining of validity and reliability of a Turkish version of Transition Readiness Assessment Questionaire that assess readiness for transition from pediatric to adult health care for adolescents/ young adults with diabetes. STUDY DESIGN: Methodological study. METHODS: Participants were 109 adolescents/ young adults with type 1 diabetes aged 14 to 21 years. After obtaining permission to adapt the Transition Readiness Assessment Questionaire, Turkish Transition Readiness Assessment Questionaire and \"self care scale\" were applied to participants through face to face interviews in two pediatric endocrinology clinics. Validity was evaluated by exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis and content-scope validity; reliability was evaluated by item-total score correlation and continuity methods. Internal reliability was assessed by Cronbach's alpha and criterion validity. RESULTS: The item analysis, Explatory Factor Analysis and Confirmatory Factor Analysis identified 5 basic dimensions with high internal consistency (0.89 to 0.75). x2/df and the other conformity indices were good fit to the data. The correlation coefficient in the analyses of test-retest scores was .86 for the total scale (p<0.05) and the Cronbach\"s alpha coefficient was found as 0.88 for overall scale. CONCLUSION: The Turkish version of Transition Readiness Assessment Questionaire is a valid and reliable measure of transition readiness of adolescents/young adults with diabetes in Turkey. Transition Readiness Assessment Questionaire assesses self management ability and HCT knowledge of the adolescents/young adults with diabetes who need special health care.

2017 Sep.","AIM: Central nervous system impairment is common in patients with diabetes, even in the early stages of the disease. The aim of the study was to evaluate central nerve conduction changes in children and adolescents with newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus using pattern-reversal visual-evoked potentials. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Pattern-reversal visual-evoked potentials were assessed in 48 patients with type 1 (age 11.9+/-2.9 years) and 18 patients with type 2 (age 14.8+/-1.3 years) diabetes less than a month after diagnosis and in 33 control subjects (age 12.9+/-3.9 years). RESULTS: P100 latencies were significantly delayed in patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes compared with control subjects (p<0.001). There was no correlation between P100 latencies and age at diagnosis. No correlations were found between P100 latencies and HbA1c values in patients with type 1 diabetes. However, P100 latencies were significantly associated with levels of HbA1c in patients with type 2 diabetes (p<0.01). There was a marked inter-individual variability in amplitudes of N75 to P100 in both patients with diabetes and controls. The amplitudes of N75 to P100 were not associated with levels of HbA1c in patients with diabetes. Negative correlations between amplitudes of N75 to P100 and age at diagnosis were noted in patients with type 1 diabetes (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The impaired visual-evoked potential latencies in children and adolescents with newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus suggest an early involvement of the optic pathway.

Oct;19(10):1066-1069.","OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in children with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed for the clinical data of 224 children with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes, and according to the presence or absence of DKA, these children were divided into DKA group and non-DKA group, with 112 children in each group. The DKA group was further divided into >/=5-year group (65 children) and <5-year group (47 children), and according to the blood gas parameters, this group was divided into mild group (26 children), moderate group (29 children), and severe group (57 children). The factors influencing the development of DKA were analyzed, as well as the clinical and laboratory features of DKA children with different ages. RESULTS: The most common symptoms in these 224 children with type 1 diabetes were polydipsia (86.2%), polyuria (78.6%), and weight loss (57.1%). Compared with the non-DKA group, the DKA group had a significantly higher percentage of children who were aged <5 years, who had low family income, or whose parents had an educational level of senior high school or below. The DKA group had significantly higher levels of random blood glucose and HbA1C and significantly lower levels of pH, HCO3-, and C-peptide than the non-DKA group (P<0.05). There was no significant difference in the percentage of children with severe DKA between the >/=5-year group and the <5-year group (P>0.05). Compared with the <5-year group, the >/=5-year group sufferred from symptoms for a significantly prolonged period, and had a significantly lower level of random blood glucose and significantly higher levels of HbA1C and C-peptide (P<0.05).

Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are defective in T1D setting. Therefore, efforts to repair or restore Tregs in T1D may prevent or reverse this autoimmune disease. Here, we studied the potential role of rgp96 in preventing T1D, using non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice as an animal model. High-dose rgp96 immunization elicited efficient protection of mice against T1D, as evidenced by stable blood glucose, decreased disease incidence. Significantly increased CD4(+) CD25(+) Foxp3(+) Tregs were observed in immunized mice. In vitro co-culture experiments demonstrated that rgp96 stimulation enhanced Treg proliferation and suppressive function by up-regulation of Foxp3 and IL-10. Our work shows that activation of Tregs by high-dose rgp96 immunization protects against T1D via inducing regulatory T cells and provides preventive and therapeutic potential for the development of an rgp96-based vaccine against T1D.","type+1+diabetes",["Type","1","diabetes","(T1D),","the","most","prevalent","human","autoimmune","disease,","occurs","in","genetically","susceptible","individuals.","Regulatory","T","cells","(Tregs)","are","defective","in","T1D","setting.","Therefore,","efforts","to","repair","or","restore","Tregs","in","T1D","may","prevent","or","reverse","this","autoimmune","disease.","Here,","we","studied","the","potential","role","of","rgp96","in","preventing","T1D,","using","non-obese","diabetic","(NOD)","mice","as","an","animal","model.","High-dose","rgp96","immunization","elicited","efficient","protection","of","mice","against","T1D,","as","evidenced","by","stable","blood","glucose,","decreased","disease","incidence.","Significantly","increased","CD4(+)","CD25(+)","Foxp3(+)","Tregs","were","observed","in","immunized","mice.","In","vitro","co-culture","experiments","demonstrated","that","rgp96","stimulation","enhanced","Treg","proliferation","and","suppressive","function","by","up-regulation","of","Foxp3","and","IL-10.","Our","work","shows","that","activation","of","Tregs","by","high-dose","rgp96","immunization","protects","against","T1D","via","inducing","regulatory","T","cells","and","provides","preventive","and","therapeutic","potential","for","the","development","of","an","rgp96-based","vaccine","against","T1D."],["Type","1","diabetes","(T1D),","prevalent","human","autoimmune","disease,","occurs","genetically","susceptible","individuals.","Regulatory","cells","(Tregs)","defective","T1D","setting.","Therefore,","efforts","repair","restore","Tregs","T1D","may","prevent","reverse","autoimmune","disease.","Here,","studied","potential","role","rgp96","preventing","T1D,","using","non-obese","diabetic","(NOD)","mice","animal","model.","High-dose","rgp96","immunization","elicited","efficient","protection","mice","T1D,","evidenced","stable","blood","glucose,","decreased","disease","incidence.","Significantly","increased","CD4(+)","CD25(+)","Foxp3(+)","Tregs","observed","immunized","mice.","vitro","co-culture","experiments","demonstrated","rgp96","stimulation","enhanced","Treg","proliferation","suppressive","function","up-regulation","Foxp3","IL-10.","work","shows","activation","Tregs","high-dose","rgp96","immunization","protects","T1D","via","inducing","regulatory","cells","provides","preventive","therapeutic","potential","development","rgp96-based","vaccine","T1D."],[0,300,[0,7,12,20,21,23,24,26,34,38,39,41,45,50,52,55,56,64,65,66,68,74,76,83,86,90,95,99,100,105,107,109,111,112,117,120,125,127,129,134,136,138,139,144,160,161,164,166,167,168,171,173,175,178,183,186,187,188,202,203,206,211,213,216,219,227,238,242,254,262,266,271,272,273,277,280,286,287,290,298],[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0]],[0,300,[0,7,12,20,21,23,24,26,34,38,39,41,45,50,52,55,56,64,65,66,68,74,76,83,86,90,95,99,100,105,107,109,111,112,117,120,125,127,129,134,136,138,139,144,160,161,164,166,167,168,171,173,175,178,183,186,187,188,202,203,206,211,213,216,219,227,238,242,254,262,266,271,272,273,277,280,286,287,290,298],[1.229293833954521,1.6910838646628676,1.1656416591140484,1.0154719451674472,1.4080136374336496,1.6181451414000296,0.9927122369619654,3.5434014846232524,2.9203987812084398,1.440906187669541,3.2136794168605975,1.0711012599602607,1.1729232446853115,1.8348443340632539,1.200085408371465,0.8289966960047991,0.9509984625652311,0.8333238338686806,1.4080136374336496,1.1926040767191763,1.3467547565464346,1.219037333787332,1.3337956119039294,0.9578511570272716,1.3195908276056123,1.0040905496773007,0.8118729899262077,0.7311774981052004,2.0751329577473805,0.9637625042903288,2.966377817657837,1.0196429626847854,1.5169759064063018,1.4034017922110866,1.4881847560222903,1.9755273127797435,1.4683493949661444,1.3540275158755144,1.7122636801959268,1.014431903472033,0.8084831561716962,2.8627947994010277,0.8490584242222367,1.3660429223855652,1.252762968495368,1.216489561708533,1.1080802632013482,0.7900417282689732,1.4266766985655763,1.0196429626847854,1.147666339895413,1.0989892915000963,0.7226004474734408,1.3613535559675873,1.5808273783928346,1.34386039852007,1.400339002680541,1.3352272513753671,1.5118345069058832,1.0877405789642256,2.684832709895673,0.8411601821979965,1.0113182527987536,0.9807036169791469,1.8538018219723413,1.395762335653129,2.458587667909042,1.1149531424891101,0.7825944451936896,1.4345569599908823,1.575347912628209,1.4618240863312217,0.9278537457414425,1.0113182527987536,3.200131420628314,1.1172546394773895,0.7453733200933924,1.5626780598871572,3.8344452995686136,1.6951822310551499]],1.0],["A

particularly in Westernised societies, there is an urgent need to understand the early molecular and metabolic alterations that accompany the autoimmune disease. This is not least because in murine models early intervention can prevent the development of overt disease. In this study we have applied a liquid chromatography (LC-) and gas chromatography (GC-) mass spectrometry (MS) metabolomics and lipidomics analysis of blood plasma and pancreas tissue extracts to follow the progression of disease in three models related to autoimmune diabetes: the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse, which is susceptible to the development of autoimmune diabetes, and the NOD-E (transgenic NOD mice that express the I-E heterodimer of the major histocompatibility complex II) and NOD- severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mouse strains, two models protected from the development of diabetes. All three analyses highlighted the metabolic differences between the NOD-SCID mouse and the other two strains, regardless of diabetic status.

potent nutraceutical combination of Cinnamomum cassia &Nigella sativa for Type 1 diabetes mellitus.",["Kaur G","Invally M","Khan MK","Jadhav P"],"J Ayurveda Integr Med. 2017 Oct 5. pii: S0975-9476(16)30445-4. doi: 10.1016/j.jaim.2017.02.005.","BACKGROUND: Nigella sativa (black cumin) and Cinnamomum cassia (Cinnamon) are an integral part of the Indian diet, and have also been sourced in the ayurveda, the traditional Indian system of medicine, for their medicinal properties. Both the herbs individually have been successfully evaluated for their preliminary antidiabetic potential. AIM: Herein, we dived deeper into antidiabetic properties of these herbs, by investigating the combinatorial effect of both herbs, on parameters of diabetes and further, as an adjunct to metformin therapy, for assessing the pharmacodynamics of herb-drug interaction in diabetes mellitus. The objectives were to screen the combinatorial extract of Nigella sativa & Cinnamomum cassia's (NSCCe) alone and in combination with metformin for its potential in mitigating symptoms of diabetes mellitus-alone, and as an adjunct therapy with metformin. METHODS: Diabetes was induced in the animals by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin. Animals were divided into seven groups with 6 animals each: Vehicle control, Negative control, Positive control (Metformin 50 mg/kg), treatment groups 4 and 5 received NSCCe at the doses of 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg, respectively. Groups 6 and 7 received the same doses, in combination with Metformin (50 and 25 mg/kg). Following a 28-day dosing period, plasma glucose levels, lipid profile and renal function profile were evaluated. Histopathological examinations were performed to measure any morphological change in kidney, liver and pancreatic tissue. RESULTS: Combination of Nigella sativa & Cinnamomum cassia extracts significantly normalized plasma glucose levels, lipid profile and kidney function parameters, compared to the diabetic control group. Animals treated with the combinatorial extract and metformin showed more prominent effects on these parameters. Significant reversal in the pancreatic cell damage was observed on treatment with NSCCe.

Implantable sensors could overcome some challenges reportedly associated with device visibility, psychosocial functioning and sensor durability. METHODS: A psychosocial assessment was conducted to determine acceptability and impact of an implantable continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensor as part of the PRECISE trial. Questionnaires were administered to participants comprising the Diabetes Distress Scale, the CGM impact scale, and bespoke device satisfaction. RESULTS: Fifty-one participants across the United Kingdom (n = 10) and Germany (n = 41) completed the questionnaires. Of these, 90% had T1D, 50% followed an insulin pump therapy regimen, and 45% of the participants were previous CGM users. CGM Impact Scale results show 86% (n = 44) of participants reported feeling better (14% neutral) about their diabetes control with 90% CGM naive participants and 81% previous CGM users reporting increased confidence about their diabetes management. Furthermore, 73% (n = 37) felt more safe (27% neutral) while sleeping and 78% (n = 39) more confident (22% neutral) about avoiding serious hypoglycemia. Responses correspond with an average improvement in HbA1c from 7.51 to 7.05 ( P < .0001) over the 90 days use of the CGM. Overall, the system was rated highly on ease of use, convenience and comfort. 84% would choose to be inserted again with 93% of CGM naive participants (86% previous CGM users) reporting minimized burden of diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Implantable CGM devices are acceptable to users and are evaluated favorably.

of CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocytes by insulin and GAD in patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus.",["Arneth BM"],"Endocr Connect. 2017 Oct 6. pii: EC-17-0230. doi: 10.1530/EC-17-0230.","BACKGROUND: The origin of autoimmune disease type 1 diabetes is still unknown. AIM: This study assessed the activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocytes by human insulin and human glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and healthy volunteers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The expression of CD69, a marker of T-lymphocyte activity, was determined in whole blood samples by flow cytometry after 12 h of incubation with or without insulin or GAD. The analysis included samples from 12 type 1 DM patients, 14 type 2 DM patients, and 12 healthy volunteers. RESULTS: Significant increases in the number of activated CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocytes following pre-incubation of whole blood samples with human insulin or GAD were observed in samples from patients with type 1 DM, whereas no activation of these cells was detected in samples from either type 2 DM patients or healthy subjects. DISCUSSION: These results indicated that latent pre-activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocytes in response to insulin or GAD epitopes occurred in type 1 DM patients. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that pre-immunization against insulin and/or GAD might be associated with the development of type 1 DM.

Perceptions of Peer Responses to Diabetes Self-Management: A Qualitative Study.",["Yang PY","Lou MF","Lien AS","Gau BS"],"J Nurs Res. 2017 Oct 12. doi: 10.1097/jnr.0000000000000234.","BACKGROUND: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is more prevalent in adolescents than in adults, and the self-management of insulin-dependent diabetes is complex. T1D requires injections of insulin, self-management of blood testing, regular physical activity, and diet monitoring, which are challenging for growing and developing adolescents. Adolescents are often more concerned with how they are perceived by their peers than how they perceive themselves. Positive peer responses influence the self-care management of adolescents with T1D in school settings. By contrast, negative peer responses and avoidance behaviors threaten to negatively affect the health outcomes of adolescents with T1D. Evidence indicates that peer influence is crucial to the successful self-management of diabetes in adolescents. However, very few studies have investigated the effect of peer influence on adolescents with T1D. PURPOSE: This article describes how adolescents with T1D perceive the responses of their peers to their diabetes self-management in school settings. METHODS: Ten 12- to 17-year-old adolescents with diabetes were recruited from a pediatric endocrinology clinic at a university hospital in Taiwan. Audio-recorded interview data were transcribed verbatim and reviewed for accuracy. A thematic analysis approach was used to analyze the narrative content of semistructured interviews with participants. The rigor of the data collection and analysis was emphasized. RESULTS: Analysis of peer responses to the diabetes care practices of the participants revealed six themes: knowledge seeking, curiosity, enthusiasm, empathy, fearfulness, and isolation and bullying. Subthemes were categorized to illustrate how adolescents with T1D balance the challenge of diabetes self-care regimens and normal peer interactions. They were coping with the requirements of their T1D regimen and hoping to determine the perceptions of their peers toward this regimen and themselves. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Understanding the perception of peer identity for adolescents with T1D provides information for diabetes education and assists school nurses to facilitate successful T1D management in

10.1111/pin.12600.","Metabolic syndrome (MS) is a worldwide healthcare issue and a dominant risk factor for the development of incurable diseases affecting the entire body. The hepatic manifestations of MS include nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its progressive variant, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NASH is known to progress to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Excellent animal models for determining the mechanism of pathogenesis and establishing therapeutic treatment of NASH/HCC are strongly required worldwide. We recently reported that two previously established mouse models of obesity and diabetes mellitus, namely, Tsumura-Suzuki Obese Diabetes (TSOD) mice and MSG mice, developed MS-associated NASH and that their clinical course and pathological characteristics closely mimicked those of human MS-NASH patients. Interestingly, most of the mice developed HCC with advancing age, and the pathological and functional characteristics of this condition were identical to those of human HCC. We further established a novel mouse model of HCC based on type 1 diabetes (DIAR-nSTZ mice) and reported its histopathological features.

The purpose was to assess how type 1 diabetes, perceived social support, perception of the illness and treatment can be predictors of health related quality of life and how these factors associate. Additional purpose was to establish the reliability of Illness Index and Treatment Index among Greek population. Four questionnaires were used, the Missoula-VITAS Quality of Life Index-15 (MVQoLI-15), the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), the Illness Index, and the Treatment Index. Participants were type 1 diabetics. The sample consists of 60 volunteers, 19 males and 41 females. All participants were Greeks. There was a correlation between variables of social support, treatment and illness index and the variables of HRQOL. Several domains of social support, the illness and treatment perception, are statistically significant predictors of the total HRQOL. Treatment and Illness Scales were found highly reliable among Greek population (20 items; alpha = 0.93). Results suggest that social support interacts with relationships, spirituality and the total QOL. Family interacts with spirituality and total QOL. This study indicates friends as the most important and positive factor towards most of the HR-QOL's subsections. Findings support that perception of the condition (II) and perception of the treatment (TI) are predictors of HRQOL.

diseases, characterized by different impact and severity, according to the organs involved. Autoimmune thyroid disorders (i.e. Hashimoto's thyroiditis and Graves' disease) and type 1 diabetes mellitus are the most common autoimmune endocrine disorders, while hypophysitis, adrenalitis (90% of cases of primary hypocortisolism or Addison's disease), premature ovarian failure and hypoparathyroidism represent quite rare conditions. Autoimmune endocrine diseases can also coexist in the same individuals and cluster in families. Some of these associations are nosologically codified in the so-called autoimmune polyglandular syndromes, but autoimmune endocrinopathies can also be accompanied by other non-endocrine autoimmune disorders (i.e. connective tissue, skin or gastrointestinal diseases). Pathophysiology generally results from a complex interplay among genetic predisposition and environmental/endogenous factors. In the diagnostic process, measurement of organ-specific autoantibodies, both with a causative role or as an epiphenomenon, is often fundamental and integrates the assessment of hormone axes and the targeted imaging

10.5812/ijem.42150. eCollection 2017 Apr.","CONTEXT: Controlling diabetes, a worldwide metabolic disease, by effective alternative treatments is currently a topic of great interest. Camel milk is believed to be a suitable hypoglycemic agent in experimental animals and patients with diabetes. The current systematic review aimed at evaluating the effect of camel milk on diabetes. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A comprehensive search was dine in PubMed and Scopus for all clinical trials and animal studies documented up to 2015, which focused on the effect of camel milk on diabetes markers. Studies which assessed the effects of camel milk, with no dose limit, on glucose parameters and lipid profiles in animals or humans with diabetes, were included. The quality of the included clinical trials was evaluated by the Delphi score checklist. RESULTS: The initial search yielded 73 articles. After screening abstracts and full texts, 22 articles were included consisting of 11 animal studies and 11 clinical trials, 8 of which focused on type 1 diabetes and the other three on type 2diabetes. All animal studies except for 1 showed significant reductions in at least 1 of the diabetes parameters such as blood glucose, insulin resistance, glycated hemoglobin, and lipid profile. In most of the clinical trials, the recommended dose of camel milk was 500 mL/day, which led to improvement of diabetes markers even after 3 months in patients with diabetes.

complication of type 1 diabetes mellitus(T1DM). CAN diagnosis is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, often due to progressive atherosclerosis. Carotid intima media thickness(CIMT) is a surrogate marker of the atherosclerosis. The aim of our study was to evaluate the relationship between CIMT and CAN in T1DM patients. METHODS: Total of 49 T1DM patients and 45 healthy controls were examined for CAN presence and CIMT. CAN was diagnosed based on the results of Ewing test battery and spectral analysis of heart rate variability. CIMT was measured by two-dimensional ultrasound. Biochemical, anthropometric and anamnestic risk markers of atherosclerosis were evaluated. We used logistic types of generalized additive models(GAM) for statistical analysis. RESULTS: CAN was detected in 22 out of 49 T1DM patients(45%). All 45 healthy controls had normal cardiovascular autonomic tests results. CIMT was significantly positively associated with T1DM diagnosis(p=0.0251), CAN diagnosis(p=0.007), age(p<0.0001), BMI(p=0.0435) and systolic blood pressure(p=0.0098). CAN effect on CIMT interacted with the effect of T1DM. The combination of both factors significantly increased CIMT more than the sum of the individual T1DM and CAN status. CONCLUSIONS: CAN is significantly associated with higher CIMT in T1DM patients. CAN may play a role in pathogenesis of atherosclerosis in type 1 diabetes mellitus.","type+1+diabetes",["AIMS:","Cardiac","autonomic","neuropathy(CAN)","is","a","frequent","and","severe","complication","of","type","1","diabetes","mellitus(T1DM).","CAN","diagnosis","is","associated","with","increased","cardiovascular","morbidity","and","mortality,","often","due","to","progressive","atherosclerosis.","Carotid","intima","media","thickness(CIMT)","is","a","surrogate","marker","of","the","atherosclerosis.","The","aim","of","our","study","was","to","evaluate","the","relationship","between","CIMT","and","CAN","in","T1DM","patients.","METHODS:","Total","of","49","T1DM","patients","and","45","healthy","controls","were","examined","for","CAN","presence","and","CIMT.","CAN","was","diagnosed","based","on","the","results","of","Ewing","test","battery","and","spectral","analysis","of","heart","rate","variability.","CIMT","was","measured","by","two-dimensional","ultrasound.","Biochemical,","anthropometric","and","anamnestic","risk","markers","of","atherosclerosis","were","evaluated.","We","used","logistic","types","of","generalized","additive","models(GAM)","for","statistical","analysis.","RESULTS:","CAN","was","detected","in","22","out","of","49","T1DM","patients(45%).","All","45","healthy","controls","had","normal","cardiovascular","autonomic","tests","results.","CIMT","was","significantly","positively","associated","with","T1DM","diagnosis(p=0.0251),","CAN","diagnosis(p=0.007),","age(p<0.0001),","BMI(p=0.0435)","and","systolic","blood","pressure(p=0.0098).","CAN","effect","on","CIMT","interacted","with","the","effect","of","T1DM.","The","combination","of","both","factors","significantly","increased","CIMT","more","than","the","sum","of","the","individual","T1DM","and","CAN","status.","CONCLUSIONS:","CAN","is","significantly","associated","with","higher","CIMT","in","T1DM","patients.","CAN","may","play","a","role","in","pathogenesis","of","atherosclerosis","in","type","1","diabetes","mellitus."],["AIMS:","Cardiac","autonomic","neuropathy(CAN)","frequent","severe","complication","type","1","diabetes","mellitus(T1DM).","diagnosis","associated","increased","cardiovascular","morbidity","mortality,","often","due","progressive","atherosclerosis.","Carotid","intima","media","thickness(CIMT)","surrogate","marker","atherosclerosis.","aim","study","evaluate","relationship","CIMT","T1DM","patients.","METHODS:","Total","49","T1DM","patients","45","healthy","controls","examined","presence","CIMT.","diagnosed","based","results","Ewing","test","battery","spectral","analysis","heart","rate","variability.","CIMT","measured","two-dimensional","ultrasound.","Biochemical,","anthropometric","anamnestic","risk","markers","atherosclerosis","evaluated.","used","logistic","types","generalized","additive","models(GAM)","statistical","analysis.","RESULTS:","detected","22","49","T1DM","patients(45%).","45","healthy","controls","normal","cardiovascular","autonomic","tests","results.","CIMT","significantly","positively","associated","T1DM","diagnosis(p=0.0251),","diagnosis(p=0.007),","age(p<0.0001),","BMI(p=0.0435)","systolic","blood","pressure(p=0.0098).","effect","CIMT","interacted","effect","T1DM.","combination","factors","significantly","increased","CIMT","sum","individual","T1DM","status.","CONCLUSIONS:","significantly","associated","higher","CIMT","T1DM","patients.","may","play","role","pathogenesis","atherosclerosis","type","1","diabetes","mellitus."],[0,300,[1,4,8,13,15,18,19,21,24,25,26,27,39,40,41,42,45,49,50,53,58,60,62,63,66,74,75,81,83,86,87,89,90,91,93,96,101,106,118,125,128,132,139,142,144,145,148,149,163,164,166,168,173,174,175,180,184,191,196,200,201,203,204,205,208,209,211,214,216,218,226,229,231,233,236,244,248,253,258,260,261,265,273,286,290,294,296,299],[3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0]],[0,300,[1,4,8,13,15,18,19,21,24,25,26,27,39,40,41,42,45,49,50,53,58,60,62,63,66,74,75,81,83,86,87,89,90,91,93,96,101,106,118,125,128,132,139,142,144,145,148,149,163,164,166,168,173,174,175,180,184,191,196,200,201,203,204,205,208,209,211,214,216,218,226,229,231,233,236,244,248,253,258,260,261,265,273,286,290,294,296,299],[2.687868321410247,1.4173016299001202,0.94710361830369,1.9654313801851342,1.6034755360643291,1.229293833954521,1.597448259628875,1.4080136374336496,0.4963561184809827,1.8291919515915835,1.7717007423116262,1.439315097437299,2.4102595626454484,1.0154719451674472,2.1422025199205215,0.8464187394514634,1.1729232446853115,1.1431203801211496,0.9174221670316269,1.7863797072877177,1.4204168972170694,1.0428998248490526,0.6236267437745534,0.8803808953512776,1.1926040767191763,2.438074667574664,0.9958937824731221,1.3424163549478365,0.9578511570272716,1.3195908276056123,9.529082116188562,1.23187448054

mothers/guardians demonstrate notions about the right to special vaccines for children with type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. METHOD: A descriptive, cross-sectional study with analysis of quantitative data based on interviews with mothers/guardians, particularly regarding access to childcare and vaccination against influenza and pneumococcal 23-valent (PPSV). RESULTS: 47 mothers/guardians participated in the study. The participants reported using more specialized services to follow child health, and only a few used the child care of the basic health care regularly. There were incomplete vaccination schedules, delayed annual follow-ups, missing vaccination cards at the consultations, misinformation about the special character of the vaccination, as well as emphasis on the need of presenting a specific form to obtain the vaccination, resulting in discontinuation of health actions and missed opportunities for vaccination. CONCLUSION: Fragilities in child care and immunization actions require an increase of primary health care and of the care network, based on knowledge and the right to health in order to expand the evidence-based practice, access and comprehensiveness.","type+1+diabetes",["OBJECTIVES:","Identifying","the","use","of","child","care","situations,","the","vaccination","situation","and","the","reasons","for","non-vaccination,","and","characterizing","whether","mothers/guardians","demonstrate","notions","about","the","right","to","special","vaccines","for","children","with","type","1","Diabetes","Mellitus.","METHOD:","A","descriptive,","cross-sectional","study","with","analysis","of","quantitative","data","based","on","interviews","with","mothers/guardians,","particularly","regarding","access","to","childcare","and","vaccination","against","influenza","and","pneumococcal","23-valent","(PPSV).","RESULTS:","47","mothers/guardians","participated","in","the","study.","The","participants","reported","using","more","specialized","services","to","follow","child","health,","and","only","a","few","used","the","child","care","of","the","basic","health","care","regularly.","There","were","incomplete","vaccination","schedules,","delayed","annual","follow-ups,","missing","vaccination","cards","at","the","consultations,","misinformation","about","the","special","character","of","the","vaccination,","as","well","as","emphasis","on","the","need","of","presenting","a","specific","form","to","obtain","the","vaccination,","resulting","in","discontinuation","of","health","actions","and","missed","opportunities","for","vaccination.","CONCLUSION:","Fragilities","in","child","care","and","immunization","actions","require","an","increase","of","primary","health","care","and","of","the","care","network,","based","on","knowledge","and","the","right","to","health","in","order","to","expand","the","evidence-based","practice,","access","and","comprehensiveness."],["OBJECTIVES:","Identifying","use","child","care","situations,","vaccination","situation","reasons","non-vaccination,","characterizing","whether","mothers/guardians","demonstrate","notions","right","special","vaccines","children","type","1","Diabetes","Mellitus.","METHOD:","descriptive,","cross-sectional","study","analysis","quantitative","data","based","interviews","mothers/guardians,","particularly","regarding","access","childcare","vaccination","influenza","pneumococcal","23-valent","(PPSV).","RESULTS:","47","mothers/guardians","participated","study.","participants","reported","using","specialized","services","follow","child","health,","used","child","care","basic","health","care","regularly.","incomplete","vaccination","schedules,","delayed","annual","follow-ups,","missing","vaccination","cards","consultations,","misinformation","special","character","vaccination,","well","emphasis","need","presenting","specific","form","obtain","vaccination,","resulting","discontinuation","health","actions","missed","opportunities","vaccination.","CONCLUSION:","Fragilities","child","care","immunization","actions","require","increase","primary","health","care","care","network,","based","knowledge","right","health","order","expand","evidence-based","practice,","access","comprehensiveness."],[0,300,[0,7,18,22,24,25,26,27,28,33,35,36,37,40,49,56,59,64,65,72,81,82,85,86,93,95,96,100,103,117,119,121,122,126,132,138,143,144,146,147,157,161,163,167,170,171,173,175,180,190,196,202,203,205,207,210,211,212,213,215,219,222,228,243,246,253,257,259,263,264,265,268,272,274,279,285,288,289,295,297,299],[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]],[0,300,[0,7,18,22,24,25,26,27,28,33,35,36,37,40,49,56,59,64,65,72,81,82,85,86,93,95,96,100,103,117,119,121,122,126,132,138,143,144,146,147,157,161,163,167,170,171,173,175,180,190,196,202,203,205,207,210,211,212,213,215,219,222,228,243,246,253,257,259,263,264,265,268,272,274,279,285,288,289,295,297,299],[1.229293833954521,1.6910838646628676,1.229293833954521,2.316825423941794,1.489068355442948,2.743787927387375,0.8858503711558131,1.439315097437299,1.1288422546497774,1.195091640190978,6.067903625625207,1.1536222836482644,1.1851783000223266,1.0154719451674472,0.5715601900605748,1.9019969251304623,1.2660433761632623,0.8333238338686806,1.4080136374336496,2.7073218402480297,1.3424163549478365,1.2945198766042203,0.9908047129656508,1.3195908276056123,1.7046838931542956,0.8118729899262077,1.0711012599602607,2.0751329577473805,1.6648462344460104,2.9763695120445806,1.456957896680049,0.8246882016190752,1.311163811443732,1.1393871678263923,0.9412896484382702,2.8627947994010277,5.834309320929408,0.6830214611927826,2.0371971523337584,1.3467547565464346,0.9897899995351042,1.216489561708533,2.7227071119351747,1.4266766985655763,1.452115272204261,1.147666339895413,2.1979785830001926,0.7226004474734408,0.5576388515419669,1.4126468503551377,1.6614506098108337,1.5118345069058832,1.0877405789642256,0.8034198542151494,1.2863006522510883,6.9721

We searched the relevant literatures in detail to judge the effect of different climates on incidence of CT1DM. The climates included Mediterranean, monsoon, oceanic, continental, savanna, and rainforest. According to different climates, we further researched relevant factor such as sunshine durations and latitudes. The overall incidence of CT1DM in 72 countries was 11.43 (95% CI 10.31-12.55) per 100,000 children/yr. The incidence of CT1DM in Oceanic climate [10.56 (8.69-12.42)] is highest compared with other climates; the incidence in 40 degrees -66 degrees 34'N/S [14.71 (12.30-17.29)] is higher than other latitude groups; the incidence in sunshine durations with 3-4 hours per day [15.17 (11.14-19.20)] is highest compared with other two groups; the incidence of CT1DM from 2000 to 2012 [19.58 (14.55-24.60)] is higher than other periods; all p < 0.01. Incidence of CT1DM was increasing from 1965 to 2012, but incidence in Oceanic climate is higher than other climates. Furthermore, it is higher in centers with higher latitude and lower sunshine durations.

anonymised primary care records. We identify and extract all patients with type 2 diabetes and associated clinical data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) to inform models of disease progression and stratification of treatment. PARTICIPANTS: Data were extracted from CPRD on 8 August 2016. The initial data set contained all patients (n=313 485) in the database who had received a type 2 diabetes medication. Criteria were applied to identify and exclude those with type 1 diabetes, polycystic ovarian syndrome or other forms of diabetes (n=40 204), and for data quality control (n=12). We identified 251 338 patients for inclusion in future analyses of diabetes progression and treatment response. FINDINGS TO DATE: For 6-month response to treatment, measured by change in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), we have 91 765 patients with 119 785 treatment response episodes. The greatest impact on reduction of HbA1c occurs with first-line and second-line treatments, metformin and sulfonylurea. Patients moving to third-line treatments tend to have greater weights and higher body mass index. We have investigated the impact of non-adherence to commonly used glucose-lowering medications on HbA1c. For baseline-adjusted HbA1c change over 1 year, non-adherent patients had lower HbA1c reductions than adherent patients, with mean and 95% CI of -4.4 (-4.7 to -4.0) mmol/mol (-0.40 (-0.43 to -0.37) %). FUTURE PLANS: Findings from studies using these data will help inform future treatment plans and guidelines. Additional data are added with updates from CPRD. This will increase the numbers of patients on newer medications and add more data on those already receiving treatment. There are several ongoing studies investigating different hypotheses regarding differential response to treatment and progression of diabetes.

B4 as a Causative Agent of Diabetes Mellitus Type 1: Is There a Role of Inefficiently Treated Drinking Water and Sewage in Virus Spreading?",["El-Senousy WM","Abdel-Moneim A","Abdel-Latif M","El-Hefnawy MH","Khalil RG"],"Food Environ Virol. 2017 Oct 11. doi: 10.1007/s12560-017-9322-4.","This study proposed to detect the enterovirus (EV) infection in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) and to assess the role of insufficiently treated water and sewage as sources of viral spreading. Three hundred and eighty-two serum specimens of children with T1D, one hundred serum specimens of children who did not suffer from T1D as control, and forty-eight water and sewage samples were screened for EV RNA using nested RT-PCR. The number of genome copies and infectious units of EVs in raw and treated sewage and water samples were investigated using real-time (RT)-PCR and plaque assay, respectively. T1D markers [Fasting blood glucose (FBG), HbA1c, and C-peptide], in addition to anti-Coxsackie A & B viruses (CVs A & B) IgG, were measured in control, T1D-negative EV (T1D-EV-), and T1D-positive EV (T1D-EV+) children specimens. The prevalence of EV genome was significantly higher in diabetic children (26.2%, 100 out of 382) than the control children (0%, 0 out of 100). FBG and HbA1c in T1D-EV- and T1D-EV+ children specimens were significantly higher than those in the control group, while c-peptide in T1D-EV- and T1D-EV+ children specimens was significantly lower than that in the control (n = 100; p < 0.001). Positivity of anti-CVs A & B IgG was 70.7, 6.7, and 22.9% in T1D-EV+, T1D-EV-, and control children specimens, respectively. The prevalence of EV genome in drinking water and treated sewage samples was 25 and 33.3%, respectively. The prevalence of EV infectious units in drinking water and treated sewage samples was 8.5 and 25%, respectively. Quantification assays were performed to assess the capabilities of both wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and water treatment plants (WTPs) to remove EV. The reduction of EV genome in Zenin WWTP ranged from 2 to 4 log10, while the reduction of EV infectious units ranged from 1 to 4 log10. The reduction of EV genome in El-Giza WTP ranged from 1 to 3 log10, while the reduction of EV infectious units ranged from 1 to 2 log10. This capability of reduction did not prevent the appearance of infectious EV in treated sewage and drinking water. Plaque purification was performed for isolation of separate EV isolates from treated and untreated water and sewage samples. Characterization of the EV amplicons by RT-PCR followed by sequencing of these isolates revealed high homology (97%) with human coxsackievirus B4 (CV B4) in 60% of the isolates, while the rest of the isolates belonged to poliovirus type 1 and type 2 vaccine strains. On the other hand, characterization of the EV amplicons by RT-PCR followed by sequencing for T1D-EV+ children specimens indicated that all samples contained CV B4 with the same sequence characterized in the environmental samples.

autoimmune disease that results from the destruction of pancreatic beta-cells by the immune system that involves innate and adaptive immune cells. Mucosal-associated invariant T cells (MAIT cells) are innate-like T-cells that recognize derivatives of precursors of bacterial riboflavin presented by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-related molecule MR1. Since T1D is associated with modification of the gut microbiota, we investigated MAIT cells in this pathology. In patients with T1D and mice of the non-obese diabetic (NOD) strain, we detected alterations in MAIT cells, including increased production of granzyme B, which occurred before the onset of diabetes. Analysis of NOD mice that were deficient in MR1, and therefore lacked MAIT cells, revealed a loss of gut integrity and increased anti-islet responses associated with exacerbated diabetes.

NS"],"Lab Chip. 2017 Oct 4. doi: 10.1039/c7lc00890b.","The long-term management of type-1 diabetes (T1D) is currently achieved through lifelong exogenous insulin injections. Although there is no cure for T1D, transplantation of pancreatic islets of Langerhans has the potential to restore normal endocrine function versus the morbidity of hypoglycemic unawareness that is commonly associated with sudden death among fragile diabetics. However, since endocrine islet tissues form a small proportion of the pancreas, sufficient islet numbers can be reached only by combining islets from multiple organ donors and the transplant plug contains significantly high levels of exocrine acinar tissue, thereby exacerbating immune responses. Hence, lifelong administration of immunosuppressants is required after transplantation, which can stress islet cells. The density gradient method that is currently used to separate islets from acinar tissue causes islets to be sparsely distributed over the centrifuged bins, so that the transplant sample obtained by combining multiple bins also contains significant acinar tissue levels. We show that in comparison to the significant size and density overlaps between the islet and acinar tissue populations post-organ digestion, their deformability overlaps are minimal. This feature is utilized to design a microfluidic separation strategy, wherein tangential flows enable selective deformation of acinar populations towards the bifurcating waste stream and sequential switching of hydrodynamic resistance enables the collection of rigid islets. Using 25 bifurcating daughter channels, a throughput of approximately 300 islets per hour per device is obtained for enabling islet enrichment from relatively dilute starting levels to purity levels that meet the transplant criteria, as well as to further enhance islet purity from samples following density gradient enrichment. Based on confirmation of viability and functionality of the microfluidic-isolated islets using insulin secretion analysis and an angiogenesis assay, we envision utilizing this strategy to generate

of preeclampsia in women with type 1 diabetes.",["Gutaj P","Zawiejska A","Mantaj U","Wender-Ozegowska E"],"Acta Diabetol. 2017 Oct 3. doi: 10.1007/s00592-017-1053-3.","AIMS: Despite improvement in diabetic care over the years, the incidence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy is still very high. Therefore, the aim of our study was to determine risk factors for PE in women with T1DM. METHODS: This study was a prospective, nested case-control study on a population of 165 women with T1DM. Women were divided into 3 subgroups: normotensive (N = 141), gestational hypertension (GH) (N = 8), and PE (N = 16). Clinical data were collected in the first trimester (< 12th week), in mid-pregnancy (20-24th weeks), and just prior to delivery (34-39th weeks). IR in the first trimester was quantified using the estimated glucose disposal rate formula (eGDR, milligrams/kilogram/minute). Simple logistic regression was used to search for factors associated with PE and GH. For multivariate comparisons, we used multiple logistic regression with stepwise selection. RESULTS: All preeclampsia cases were diagnosed in primiparae. The presence of vasculopathy was the strongest determinant of PE (OR 10.8, 95% CI 3.27-35.97, P = 0.0001), followed by a history of chronic hypertension (6.05, 1.75-20.8, P = 0.004) and the duration of diabetes (1.11, 1.03-1.12, P = 0.009). However, chronic hypertension and duration of diabetes were no longer associated with PE after adjustment for the presence of vasculopathy. Higher gestational weight gain (GWG) was associated with PE, and this association remained significant after adjustment for first trimester body mass index (1.14, 1.02-1.28, P = 0.02). Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure assessed in the first trimester were significant determinants of PE; however, this association was no longer observed after adjustment for the presence of chronic hypertension. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels from all 3 trimesters were significantly associated with PE (first trimester: 1.38, 1.01-1.87, P = 0.04; second trimester: 2.76, 1.43-5.31, P = 0.002; third trimester: 2.42, 1.30-4.51, P = 0.005). There was a negative association between eGDR and PE (0.66, 0.50-0.87, P = 0.003). Among lipids, triglycerides (TG) in all 3 trimesters were positively associated with PE, and this association was independent of HbA1c levels (first trimester: 5.32, 1.65-17.18, P = 0.005; second trimester: 2.52, 1.02-6.26, P = 0.05; third trimester: 2.28, 1.39-3.74, P = 0.001. We did not find any predictors of GH in the regression analysis among all analyzed factors. CONCLUSIONS: Primiparity and diabetic vasculopathy seem to be the strongest risk factors for PE in women with type 1 diabetes. However, preexisting hypertension and higher GWG were also associated with PE in women with T1DM. Among laboratory results, higher HbA1c and TG levels in all 3 trimesters were associated with PE.

population is a well-defined specialty of medicine. It calls for an immaculately designed health-care plan to treat diseases in geriatrics. For chronic illnesses such as diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary heart disease, and hypertension (HTN), they require proper management throughout the rest of patient's life. An integrated treatment pathway helps in treatment decision-making and improving standards of health care for the patient. CASE PRESENTATION: This case describes an exclusive clinical pharmacist-driven designing of an integrated treatment pathway for a post-coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) geriatric male patient with DM type I and HTN for the treatment of hypoglycemia and electrolyte imbalance. INTERVENTION: The treatment begins addressing the chief complaints which were vomiting and unconsciousness. Biochemical screening is essential to establish a diagnosis of electrolyte imbalance along with blood glucose level after which the integrated pathway defines the treatment course. CONCLUSION: This individualized treatment pathway provides an outline of the course of treatment of acute hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalance as well as some unconfirmed diagnosis, namely, acute coronary syndrome and respiratory tract infection for a post-CABG geriatric patient with HTN and type 1 DM. The eligibility criterion for patients to be treated according to treatment pathway is to fall in the defined category.","type+1+diabetes",["INTRODUCTION:","The","ailments","afflicting","the","elderly","population","is","a","well-defined","specialty","of","medicine.","It","calls","for","an","immaculately","designed","health-care","plan","to","treat","diseases","in","geriatrics.","For","chronic","illnesses","such","as","diabetes","mellitus","(DM),","coronary","heart","disease,","and","hypertension","(HTN),","they","require","proper","management","throughout","the","rest","of","patient's","life.","An","integrated","treatment","pathway","helps","in","treatment","decision-making","and","improving","standards","of","health","care","for","the","patient.","CASE","PRESENTATION:","This","case","describes","an","exclusive","clinical","pharmacist-driven","designing","of","an","integrated","treatment","pathway","for","a","post-coronary","artery","bypass","grafting","(CABG)","geriatric","male","patient","with","DM","type","I","and","HTN","for","the","treatment","of","hypoglycemia","and","electrolyte","imbalance.","INTERVENTION:","The","treatment","begins","addressing","the","chief","complaints","which","were","vomiting","and","unconsciousness.","Biochemical","screening","is","essential","to","establish","a","diagnosis","of","electrolyte","imbalance","along","with","blood","glucose","level","after","which","the","integrated","pathway","defines","the","treatment","course.","CONCLUSION:","This","individualized","treatment","pathway","provides","an","outline","of","the","course","of","treatment","of","acute","hypoglycemia,","electrolyte","imbalance","as","well","as","some","unconfirmed","diagnosis,","namely,","acute","coronary","syndrome","and","respiratory","tract","infection","for","a","post-CABG","geriatric","patient","with","HTN","and","type","1","DM.","The","eligibility","criterion","for","patients","to","be","treated","according","to","treatment","pathway","is","to","fall","in","the","defined","category."],["INTRODUCTION:","ailments","afflicting","elderly","population","well-defined","specialty","medicine.","calls","immaculately","designed","health-care","plan","treat","diseases","geriatrics.","chronic","illnesses","diabetes","mellitus","(DM),","coronary","heart","disease,","hypertension","(HTN),","require","proper","management","throughout","rest","patient's","life.","integrated","treatment","pathway","helps","treatment","decision-making","improving","standards","health","care","patient.","CASE","PRESENTATION:","case","describes","exclusive","clinical","pharmacist-driven","designing","integrated","treatment","pathway","post-coronary","artery","bypass","grafting","(CABG)","geriatric","male","patient","DM","type","HTN","treatment","hypoglycemia","electrolyte","imbalance.","INTERVENTION:","treatment","begins","addressing","chief","complaints","vomiting","unconsciousness.","Biochemical","screening","essential","establish","diagnosis","electrolyte","imbalance","along","blood","glucose","level","integrated","pathway","defines","treatment","course.","CONCLUSION:","individualized","treatment","pathway","provides","outline","course","treatment","acute","hypoglycemia,","electrolyte","imbalance","well","unconfirmed","diagnosis,","namely,","acute","coronary","syndrome","respiratory","tract","infection","post-CABG","geriatric","patient","HTN","type","1","DM.","eligibility","criterion","patients","treated","according","treatment","pathway","fall","defined","category."],[0,300,[0,3,7,18,22,26,27,30,34,35,39,42,49,52,53,60,62,66,68,71,76,80,83,86,94,104,108,111,113,115,116,123,125,126,128,129,130,135,136,142,144,149,151,156,157,158,165,167,168,170,172,180,181,182,184,186,188,190,191,194,196,198,207,208,209,210,215,218,221,222,223,227,228,231,232,233,237,238,239,240,247,248,252,257,262,273,279,288,293,294,295,298,299],[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,9.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]],[0,300,[0,3,7,18,22,26,27,30,34,35,39,42,49,52,53,60,62,66,68,71,76,80,83,86,94,104,108,111,113,115,116,123,125,126,128,129,130,135,136,142,144,149,151,156,157,158,165,167,168,170,172,180,181,182,184,186,188,190,191,194,196,198,207,208,209,210,215,218,221,222,223,227,228,231,232,233,237,238,239,240,247,248,252,257,262,273,279,288,293,294,295,298,299],[1.229293833954521,1.2687207539339787,1.6910838646628676,1.229293833954521,1.158412711970897,2.657551113467439,1.439315097437299,1.229293833954521,1.4601993906042199,1.5169759064063018,1.6068397084302988,0.8464187394514634,1.1431203801211496,1.200085408371465,1.7863797072877177,2.0857996496981053,1.2472534875491068,3.5778122301575292,1.3467547565464346,1.1288422546497774,1.3337956119039294,1.4650814182015282,0.9578511570272716,1.3195908276056123,1.3453065303700698,2.1934588070653174,1.3687336632652098,1.5169759064

hours. METHODS: 14 individuals (7 adults with type 1 diabetes and 7 youth with type 1 diabetes/parents) who owned DADs for >/= 6 mos wore masked CGM devices over a several-week period while recording DAD alerts electronically and in paper diaries. RESULTS: During waking hours, sensitivity scores across participants were 35.9% for low BG events and 26.2% for high BG events. DAD accuracy was highly variable with 3/14 individual dogs performing statistically higher than chance. Sensitivity scores were lower during sleep hours of the person with diabetes (22.2% for low BG events and 8.4% for high BG events). DAD accuracy during sleeping hours was also highly variable, with 1/11 individual dogs performing statistically better than chance. Rate of change analyses indicated that DADs were responding to absolute BG level, rather than rapid shifts in glucose levels. CONCLUSIONS: In this study the majority of DADs did not demonstrate accurate detection of low and high BG events. However, performance varied greatly across DADs and additional studies are needed to examine factors contributing to this variability.

2. doi: 10.1093/qjmed/hcx106.","Background: Women with diabetes experience an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Aim: We aim to describe and quantify the psychological impact of the diagnosis of diabetes in pregnant women with type 1 diabetes and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) compared to each other and to their counterparts without diabetes. Design: This is a survey-based study with prospective collection of pregnancy outcome data. Methods: A total of 218 pregnant women (50% with diabetes) were administered questionnaires relating to psychological health. Maternal and neonatal characteristics and pregnancy outcomes were collected. Associations between key psychometric and health outcome variables were examined. Results: At least 25% of women in all three pregnancy groups had scores indicating affective distress in at least one domain. Compared to those with type 1 diabetes, women with GDM evidenced a greater number of uplifts in pregnancy ( U = 94, P = 0.041), but also higher levels of overall anxiety ( U = 92, P = 0.03) and stress ( U = 82, P < 0.01). Women with GDM also had significantly elevated overall depression scores, compared with the control group ( U = 34, P = 0.02). Both groups of women with diabetes had clinically elevated levels of diabetes-related distress. There were no associations between maternal psychological variables and pregnancy outcomes.

[RAGE ( AGER) and AGER1 ( DDOST)] and of the gene coding the deacetylase SIRT1 ( SIRT1) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from type 1 diabetes patients without [Group A, n = 35; 28.5 (24-39) years old; median (interquartile interval)] or with at least one microvascular complication [Group B, n = 117; 34.5 (30-42) years old]; 31 healthy controls were also included. In a subgroup of 48 patients, daily advanced glycation end-products intake before blood collection was assessed. Lower expression of DDOST was found in patients than in controls after adjustment for sex, age, use of statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. Higher expressions of AGER, DDOST and SIRT1 were observed in Group A. Stratifying by complications, AGER and DDOST expressions were higher in those without retinopathy and without diabetic kidney disease, respectively, compared to patients with these complications. Patients using statins or angiotensin receptor blockers presented higher expression of DDOST. Expression of SIRT1 was higher in patients consuming >/=12,872 KU daily of advanced glycation end-products. Although AGER, DDOST and SIRT1 are differently expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from type 1 diabetes patients with and without microvascular complications, they are also influenced by

investigate the influence of age and sex on insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion in the adolescent offspring of women with type 1 diabetes, compared with the background population. METHODS: This was a prospective nationwide follow-up study (Epigenetic, Genetic and Environmental Effects on Growth, Cognitive Functions and Metabolism in Offspring of Women with Type 1 Diabetes [EPICOM]) in a Danish population. We examined 278 offspring of women with type 1 diabetes from the Danish Diabetes Association Register born during 1993-1999 (index offspring) and 303 control offspring, identified through the Danish Central Office of Civil Registration and matched to the index offspring with respect to date of birth, sex and postal code. The offspring had an overall mean age of 16.7 years (range 13.0-20.4 years). The main outcomes were age-related changes in fasting OGTT-derived indices for insulin sensitivity (BIGTT-SI0-30-120, Matsuda index, HOMA-IR) and insulin secretion (acute insulin response [BIGTT-AIR0-0-30-120], insulinogenic index, HOMA of insulin secretory function [HOMA-beta], disposition index) and physical activity (International Physical Activity Questionnaire). In addition, we determined total body fat (TBF) percentage using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. RESULTS: We observed significantly lower insulin sensitivity in index offspring compared with control offspring, increasing with age. The differences were attenuated after adjustment for TBF percentage, but were still significant at 17 and 18 years of age. We also observed decreased disposition index and insulin secretion-sensitivity index-2 in index offspring at the same age, but we found no significant differences in other indices of insulin secretion compared with control offspring. With age, TBF percentage became increasingly more divergent between index and control offspring, and was consistently higher among female but not male index offspring. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Differences in insulin sensitivity between the offspring of women with type 1 diabetes and control offspring increased with age. This was only partially explained by higher adiposity in the index offspring.

shared allelic associations with many autoimmune diseases. However, the pathogenic contributions of variants residing in risk loci remain unresolved. The location of the majority of shared disease-associated variants in noncoding regions suggests they contribute to risk of autoimmunity through effects on gene expression in the immune system. In the current study, we test this hypothesis by applying RNA sequencing to CD4+, CD8+, and CD19+ lymphocyte populations isolated from 81 subjects with type 1 diabetes (T1D). We characterize and compare the expression patterns across these cell types for three gene sets: all genes, the set of genes implicated in autoimmune disease risk by GWAS, and the subset of these genes specifically implicated in T1D. We performed RNA sequencing and aligned the reads to both the human reference genome and a catalog of all possible splicing events developed from the genome, thereby providing a comprehensive evaluation of the roles of gene expression and alternative splicing (AS) in autoimmunity. Autoimmune candidate genes displayed greater expression specificity in the three lymphocyte populations relative to other genes, with significantly increased levels of splicing events, particularly those predicted to have substantial effects on protein isoform structure and function (e.g., intron retention, exon skipping). The majority of single-nucleotide polymorphisms within T1D-associated loci were also associated with one or more cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTLs) and/or splicing eQTLs.

composition and function of the gut microbiota) may be relevant in the development of type 1 diabetes (T1D). Thus, gut microbiota may be a target for improving outcomes in subjects with T1D. The aim of the study is to examine the effects of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12 on beta-cell function in children with newly diagnosed T1D. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A total of 96 children aged 8 to 17 years with newly diagnosed T1D, confirmed by clinical history and the presence of at least one positive autoantibody, will be enrolled in a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial in which they will receive L. rhamnosus GG and B. lactis Bb12 at a dose of 109 colony-forming units or an identically appearing placebo, orally, once daily, for 6 months. The follow-up will be for 12 months. The primary outcome measures will be the area under the curve of the C-peptide level during 2-hour responses to a mixed meal. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Bioethics Committee approved the study protocol. The findings of this trial will be submitted to a peer-reviewed paediatric journal. Abstracts will be submitted to relevant national and international conferences.

Comorbidities, Natural History, and Predictors of Early Resolution in a Cohort of Children With Chronic Urticaria.",["Netchiporouk E","Sasseville D","Moreau L","Habel Y","Rahme E","Ben-Shoshan M"],"JAMA Dermatol. 2017 Sep 27. doi: 10.1001/jamadermatol.2017.3182.","Importance: Chronic urticaria (CU) affects 0.1% to 0.3% of children. Most cases have no identifiable trigger and are classified as chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). At least half of patients with CSU may have an autoimmune etiology that can be determined in vitro using the basophil activation test (BAT). While 30% to 55% of CU cases resolve spontaneously within 5 years in adults, the natural history and predictors of resolution in children are not known. Objective: To assess the comorbidities, natural history of CU, and its subtypes in children and identify predictors of resolution. Design, Setting, and Participants: We followed a pediatric cohort with chronic urticaria that presented with hives lasting at least 6 weeks between 2013 and 2015 at a single tertiary care referral center. Exposures: Data were collected on disease activity, comorbidities, physical triggers, BAT results, complete blood cell count, C-reactive protein levels, thyroid-stimulating hormone levels, and thyroid peroxidase antibodies. Main Outcomes and Measures: We assessed the rate of resolution (defined as absence of hives for at least 1 year with no treatment) and the association with clinical and laboratory markers. Results: The cohort comprised 139 children younger than 18 years old. Thirty-one patients (20%) had inducible urticaria, most commonly cold induced. Six children had autoimmune comorbidity, such as thyroiditis and type 1 diabetes. Autoimmune disorders (24 patients [17%]) and CU (17 patients [12%]) were common in family members. Positive BAT results (CD63 levels > 1.8%) were found in 58% of patients. Patients with positive BAT results (CD63 level >1.8%) were twice as likely to resolve after 1 year compared with negative BAT results (hazard ratio [HR], 2.33; 95% CI, 1.08-5.05). In contrast, presence of basophils decreased the likelihood of resolution (HR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.20-0.99). No correlation with age was found. Chronic urticaria resolved in 43 patients, with a rate of resolution of 10.3% per year. Levels of CD63 higher than 1.8% and absence of basophils were associated with earlier disease resolution. Conclusions and Relevance: Resolution rate in children with CU is low.

Epub 2017 Sep 25.","C-peptide is the best indicator of endogenous insulin secretion in patients with diabetes. This study investigated the relationship between C-peptide levels and clinical/laboratory parameters of children with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), as measured at 6-month intervals after diagnosis. We retrospectively reviewed the data of 34 children with newly diagnosed T1DM. The study subjects were subdivided into a rapid progression group with C-peptide levels <0.6 ng/mL at 36 months (n=27; Group A) and a slow progression group with C-peptide levels >0.6 ng/mL at 36 months (n=7; Group B). Patients in Group A had a younger mean age at diagnosis (A: 9+/-4.3 years vs. B: 13.6+/-3.6 years; p=0.013) and lower body mass index (BMI) (A: 15.5+/-2.5 kg/m2 vs. B: 18.7+/-3.3 kg/m2; p=0.035). There were fewer asymptomatic patients with glucosuria in Group A, with these patients showing more severe symptoms, such as diabetic ketoacidosis (p=0.035), than those in Group B. Group A also had lower initial C-peptide levels (A: 0.5+/-0.46 ng/mL vs. B: 1.87+/-1.08 ng/mL; p=0.001). There were no significant intergroup differences in sex, family history, baseline hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), potential of hydrogen (pH), autoantibodies or serum insulin. Simple correlation analyses showed that C-peptide levels were correlated with age and BMI, but not with pH, insulin, or HbA1c.

active interest of a number of several investigators interested the global rise in the incidence of type 1 diabetes (T1D). This increase does not correlate with genetic drift and indicates that environmental exposures are playing an increasingly significant role. Despite major biomedical and technological advances in diagnosis and treatment, treatments are frequently insufficient as they do not inhibit the progression of the underlying autoimmune response and often fail to prevent life-threatening complications. T1D is the result of autoimmune destruction of the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas, and the precise, mechanistic contribution of the immune system to disease pathogenesis and progression remains to be fully characterized. Ultimately, the combinatorial effect of concurrent factors, including beta cell fragility, exogenous stressors, and genetic priming of the innate and adaptive immune system, work together to induce T1D autoimmunity. Thus, T1D is the result of immunological defects and environmental pathogens, requiring the sustained attention of collaborative research teams such as FIFE: I & D with varied perspectives, unified by the universally held goal of finding a sustainable, life-long cure.

an important role in shaping development and later life health of the fetus. It has been shown that maternal genetic factors in the metabolic pathway of vitamin D associate with type 1 diabetes in the child. In this study we analyzed the genetic determinants of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) concentration during pregnancy in mothers whose children later developed type 1 diabetes and in control mothers. STUDY DESIGN: 474 mothers of type 1 diabetic children and 348 mothers of non-diabetic children were included in the study. We previously selected 7 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in four genes in the metabolic pathway of vitamin D vitamin based on our previously published data demonstrating an association between genotype and serum 25OHD concentration. In this re-analysis, possible differences in strength in the association between the SNPs and serum 25OHD concentration in mothers of type 1 diabetic and non-diabetic children were investigated. Serum 25OHD concentrations were previously shown to be similar between the mothers of type 1 diabetic and non-diabetic children and vitamin D deficiency prevalent in both groups. RESULTS: Associations between serum 25OHD concentration and 2 SNPs, one in the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene (rs4516035) and one in the group-specific component (GC) gene (rs12512631), were stronger during pregnancy in mothers whose children later developed type 1 diabetes than in mothers whose children did not (pinteraction = 0.03, 0.02, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: We show for the first time that there are differences in the strength of genetic determinants of serum 25OHD concentration during pregnancy between the mothers of type 1 diabetic and non-diabetic children. Our results emphasize that the in utero environment including maternal vitamin D metabolism should be important lines of investigation when searching for factors that lead to early programming of type

Epub 2017 Oct 6.","Puberty is an important period for the growth and maturation of the male reproductive system, and is also a critical window for endocrine or environmental interference. The physiological levels of circulating insulin and hyperglycemic control are important factors for a normal prostate growth. Hyperglycemia during puberty is reported to retard the growth of the prostate gland, with remarkable effects on the epithelial compartment. Here, we investigated the impact of hyperglycemia along with a simultaneous or late insulin replacement on the ventral prostate growth in rats during puberty, paying special attention to the deposition of collagen fibers and activities of gelatinase, matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), and -9 (MMP-9). Hyperglycemia was induced by streptozotocin (STZ) administration in 40-day-old male Wistar rats. A subset of hyperglycemic rats underwent an early insulin replacement (three days after the STZ administration), and another subset underwent a late insulin replacement (twenty days after the STZ administration). Animals were euthanized at 60 and/or 80 days of age. The ventral prostatic lobe was processed for picrosirius red staining, type I and III collagen immunohistochemistry, and gelatin zymography. Hyperglycemic animals showed an increased area of collagen fibers in the prostate, which was composed both types of collagens. MMP-2 activity was significantly reduced in the hyperglycemic animals, while MMP-9 activity was very low and showed no alteration. The simultaneous and late insulin administration restored collagen content and MMP-2 activity. In conclusion, puberty is a critical window for prostate maturation and type-1 diabetes-induced hyperglycemia affects the ratio of the prostatic parenchymal and stromal growth, leading to fibrotic

of targeted education on managing warning and error signals by children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes using the Accu-Chek Combo Insulin Pump System.",["Deeb A","Qahtani NA","Ali AA","Akle M"],"Ann Pediatr Endocrinol Metab. 2017 Sep;22(3):170-175. doi: 10.6065/apem.2017.22.3.170. Epub 2017 Sep 28.","PURPOSE: Insulin pumps are widely used in diabetes. They are equipped with safety alarms to alert users. Pump manuals contain alarm codes and how to troubleshoot them. However, these manuals are lengthy and difficult to use, particularly in emergencies. We aim to assess the impact of targeted education on warnings and errors in improving competency to troubleshoot the alarms. METHODS: Twenty-one patients, with a median age of 13, were recruited over a 5-month period. Each patient had 2 study visits. The frequencies and types of alarms were recorded, and patients were given a summary sheet that outlined common alarms encountered and troubleshooting tips. In visit 2, the frequencies and types of alarms were compared to those of visit 1. The patients were asked to fill a questionnaire and to rate the education session given in visit 1, their level of competency in decrypting alarm codes, and their promptness in responding to alarms. RESULTS: Low cartridge (W1), low battery (W2), and bolus cancelled (W8) were the commonest warnings. The most noted errors were occlusion (E4), power interruption (E8), empty battery (E2), set not primed (E11), and cartridge empty (E1). The numbers of warning and error signals markedly decreased after targeted education (P<0.05). The ability in decrypting warning signals significantly improved (P=0.02), and the frequency of response to pump alarms significantly increased (P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Certain warnings and errors are more common than others in insulin pumps.

inflammation, neuronal loss, and expression of indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase (IDO) and quinolinic acid (QUIN) in the retina of subjects with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) and in the retina of rats with T1D. Methods: Retinas from T1D (n = 7), T2D (n = 13), and 20 age-matched nondiabetic human donors and from T1D (n = 3) and control rats (n = 3) were examined using immunohistochemistry for IDO, QUIN, cluster of differentiation 39 (CD39), ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule (Iba-1, for macrophages and microglia), Vimentin (VIM; for Muller cells), neuronal nuclei (NeuN; for neurons), and UEA1 lectin (for blood vessels). Results: Based on morphologic criteria, CD39+/ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1(Iba-1+) resident microglia and CD39-/Iba-1+ bone marrow-derived macrophages were present at higher density in T1D (13% increase) and T2D (26% increase) human retinas when compared with controls. The density and brightness of IDO+ microglia were increased in both T1D and T2D human retinas. The intensity of QUIN+ expression on CD39+ microglia and VIM+ Muller cells was greatly increased in both human T1D and T2D retinas. T1D retinas showed a 63% loss of NeuN+ neurons and T2D retinas lost approximately 43% when compared with nondiabetic human retinas. Few QUIN+ microglia-like cells were seen in nondiabetic retinas, but the numbers increased 18-fold in T1D and 7-fold in T2D in the central retina. In T1D rat retinas, the density of IDO+ microglia increased 2.8-fold and brightness increased 2.1-fold when compared with controls.

susceptibility of the autoimmune disorder, type 1 diabetes (T1D), only partially equates for the incidence of the disease. Significant evidence attributes several environmental stressors, such as vitamin D deficiency, gut microbiome, dietary antigens, and most notably virus infections in triggering the onset of T1D in these genetically susceptible individuals. Extensive epidemiological and clinical studies have provided credibility to this causal relationship. Infection by the enterovirus, coxsackievirus B, has been closely associated with onset of T1D and is considered a significant etiological agent for disease induction. Recognition of viral antigens via innate pathogen-recognition receptors induce inflammatory events which contribute to autoreactivity of pancreatic self-antigens and ultimately the destruction of insulin-secreting beta cells. The activation of these specific innate pathways and expression of inflammatory molecules, including type I and III interferon, prime the immune system to elicit either a protective regulatory response or a diabetogenic effector response.

Interleukin 18 (IL-18) is a potent proinflammatory cytokine, which is involved in the innate and adaptive immune responses, and in the pathogenesis of various diseases including T1D. Glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) is known to be an insulin-responsive glucose transporter and has been associated with various diseases, including diabetes mellitus. We investigated the association of the polymorphisms rs187238 (IL-18) and rs5435 (GLUT4) in a case-control study in Euro-Brazilians with T1D (N = 136) and healthy subjects (N = 144). Real-time PCR with TaqMan(R) fluorescent probes were applied for genotyping. All polymorphisms were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The minor allele frequencies for the G-allele (rs187238; IL-18) in healthy and T1D groups were 28.5% [95%CI = 23-34%] vs 31.6% [95%CI = 26-37%], P = 0.416, and for the T-allele (rs5435, GLUT4) were 33% [95%CI = 28-39] vs 27% [95%CI = 23-33%], P = 0.167, respectively. Genotype comparisons for both polymorphisms showed no significant differences (P > 0.05). The polymorphisms rs187238 and rs5435 were not associated with T1D in the studied population. The minor allele frequencies for both polymorphisms were similar to those of other Caucasian

10.1530/EDM-17-0086. eCollection 2017.","We describe the case of an African woman who was diagnosed with ketosis-prone diabetes with diabetes-associated autoantibodies, after being admitted for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) precipitated by her first presentation of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). She had a seven-year history of recurrent gestational diabetes (GDM) not requiring insulin therapy, with return to normoglycaemia after each pregnancy. This might have suggested that she had now developed type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, the diagnosis of SLE prompted testing for an autoimmune aetiology for the diabetes, and she was found to have a very high titre of GAD antibodies. Typical type 1 diabetes (T1D) was thought unlikely due to the long preceding history of GDM. Latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA) was considered, but ruled out as she required insulin therapy from diagnosis. The challenge of identifying the type of diabetes when clinical features overlap the various diabetes categories is discussed. This is the first report of autoimmune ketosis-prone diabetes (KPD) presenting with new onset of SLE. LEARNING POINTS: DKA may be the first presentation of a multi-system condition and a precipitating cause should always be sought, particularly in women with a history of GDM or suspected T2D.All women with GDM should undergo repeat glucose tolerance testing postpartum to exclude frank diabetes, even when post-delivery capillary blood glucose (CBG) tests are normal. They should also be advised to continue CBG monitoring during acute illness in case of new onset diabetes.KPD comprises a spectrum of diabetes syndromes that present with DKA, but subsequently have a variable course depending on the presence or absence of beta cell failure and/or diabetes autoantibodies.KPD should be considered in a patient with presumed T2D presenting with DKA, especially if

increased chronic systemic inflammation. AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of leucine supplementation and resistance training (RT) in attenuating WAT loss and improving inflammatory parameters and glucose metabolism in DM1 rats. METHODS: Thirty-two male Wistar rats were distributed into four groups: DA (sedentary and supplemented with non-essential amino acids (NEAA)), DL (sedentary and supplemented with leucine), DTA (submitted to RT and supplemented with NEAA) and DTL (submitted to RT and supplemented with leucine). DM1 was induced by streptozotocin (STZ). An 8-week period of RT consisted of climbing a ladder with a progressively increased load, and supplementation was offered in the feed. RESULTS: Glycemia, polyphagia and polydipsia were lower in DL, DTA and DTL groups compared with the DA group by approximately 20% ( p<.0001), 28% ( p=.004) and 64% ( p<.0001), respectively. Weight of total WAT and retroperitoneal adipose tissue (RPAT) were higher by approximately 21% ( p=.01) and 54% ( p=.0004), respectively, in DL, DTA and DTL groups compared with DA. However, gene expression of adiponectin and leptin in RPAT was only increased by RT (DTA and DTL) compared with DA and DL by approximately 93% ( p<.0001) and 78% ( p=.0002), respectively. Similarly, the levels of adiponectin in the serum, tissue IL-10 (RPAT) and serum IL-10 were only increased in DTA and DTL compared with DA and DL by approximately 31% ( p=.03), 45% ( p=.0009) and 35% ( p=.003), respectively.

the active compounds Gamma Amino Butyric Acid (GABA) is still limited. This study was conducted to determine the effects of ethanolic extract of A. altilis leaves decoction and GABA on blood glucose levels and insulin expression of beta-cells in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study was done by using completely randomized design and male Sprague Dewley rats. The rats were devided into normal control group and diabetic rats groups. Levels of bood glucose were measured using strip rapid test. The insulin expression in beta-cells was assessed using immunohistochemistry. Quantitative data were analyzed using ANOVA at 5% confidence level. RESULTS: The result indicated that 50 mg k-1 b.wt., GABA, 400 and 800 mg k-1 b.wt., ethanolic extract of A. altilis leaves decreased the level of blood glucose and increased the insulin expression in pancreas beta-cells. CONCLUSION: The GABA and ethanolic extract of A. altilis leaves with a minimum dose of 400 mg k-1 b.wt., can be used as an antidiabetic. Pancreas is the target organ was affected by GABA and A. altilis leaves as antidiabetic agents.

with low-grade inflammation affecting insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion. Recently, the thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) has been implicated in the activation process of the NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. In this study, we aim to determine whether the expression of TXNIP is altered in the circulating immune cells of individuals with type 2 vs type 1 diabetes and whether this can be related to specific causes and consequences of inflammation. METHODS: The expression of TXNIP, inflammatory markers, markers of the unfolded protein response (UPR) to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and enzymes involved in sphingolipid metabolism was quantified by quantitative reverse transcription real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 13 non-diabetic individuals, 23 individuals with type 1 diabetes and 81 with type 2 diabetes. A lipidomic analysis on the plasma of 13 non-diabetic individuals, 35 individuals with type 1 diabetes and 94 with type 2 diabetes was performed. The effects of ER stress or of specific lipids on TXNIP and inflammatory marker expression were analysed in human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDMs) and THP-1 cells. RESULTS: The expression of TXNIP and inflammatory and UPR markers was increased in the PBMCs of individuals with type 2 diabetes when compared with non-diabetic individuals or individuals with type 1 diabetes. TXNIP expression was significantly correlated with plasma fasting glucose, plasma triacylglycerol concentrations and specific UPR markers. Induction of ER stress in THP-1 cells or cultured HMDMs led to increased expression of UPR markers, TXNIP, NLRP3 and IL-1beta. Conversely, a chemical chaperone reduced the expression of UPR markers and TXNIP in PBMCs of individuals with type 2 diabetes. The lipidomic plasma analysis revealed an increased concentration of saturated dihydroceramide and sphingomyelin in individuals with type 2 diabetes when compared with non-diabetic individuals and individuals with type 1 diabetes. In addition, the expression of specific enzymes of sphingolipid metabolism, dihydroceramide desaturase 1 and sphingomyelin synthase 1, was increased in the PBMCs of individuals with type 2 diabetes. Palmitate or C2 ceramide induced ER stress in macrophages as well as increased expression of TXNIP, NLRP3 and IL-1beta. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In individuals with type 2 diabetes, circulating immune cells display an inflammatory phenotype that can be linked to ER stress and TXNIP expression.

fracture risk, and impaired bone defect regeneration potential. These skeletal complications are becoming important clinical challenges due to the rapidly increasing T1DM population, which necessitates developing effective treatment for T1DM-associated osteopenia/osteoporosis and bone trauma. This study aims to investigate the effects of whole-body vibration (WBV), an easy and non-invasive biophysical method, on bone microstructure, tissue-level mechanical properties and porous titanium (pTi) osseointegration in alloxan-diabetic rabbits. Six non-diabetic and twelve alloxan-treated diabetic rabbits were equally assigned to the Control, DM, and DM with WBV stimulation (WBV) groups. A cylindrical drill-hole defect was established on the left femoral lateral condyle of all rabbits and filled with a novel non-toxic Ti2448 pTi. Rabbits in the WBV group were exposed to 1h/day WBV (0.3g, 30Hz) for 8weeks. After sacrifice, the left femoral condyles were harvested for histological, histomorphometric and nanoindentation analyses. The femoral sample with 2-cm height above the defect was used for qRT-PCR analysis. The right distal femora were scanned with muCT. We found that all alloxan-treated rabbits exhibited hyperglycemia throughout the experimental period. WBV inhibited the deterioration of cancellous and cortical bone architecture and tissue-level mechanical properties via muCT, histological and nanoindentation examinations. T1DM-induced reduction of bone formation was inhibited by WBV, as evidenced by elevated serum OCN and increased mineral apposition rate (MAR), whereas no alteration was observed in bone resorption marker TRACP5b. WBV also stimulated more adequate ingrowths of mineralized bone tissue into pTi pore spaces, and improved peri-implant bone tissue-level mechanical properties and MAR in T1DM bone defects. WBV mitigated the reductions in femoral BMP2, OCN, Wnt3a, Lrp6, and beta-catenin and inhibited Sost mRNA expression but did not alter RANKL or RANK gene expression in T1DM rabbits. Our findings demonstrated that WBV improved bone architecture, tissue-level mechanical properties, and pTi osseointegration by promoting canonical Wnt signaling-mediated skeletal anabolic response. This study not only advances our understanding of T1DM skeletal sensitivity in response to external mechanical cues but also offers new treatment alternatives for T1DM-associated

for people with diabetes. Data informing support of specialist activities such as climbing and high-altitude trekking are limited. A 42-year-old man with type 1 diabetes (duration 30 years) attended a Multidisciplinary Physical Activity and Diabetes Clinic planning to climb Mont Blanc during the summer and trek to Everest Base Camp in the autumn. His aims were to complete these adventures without his diabetes impacting on their success. METHODS: We report the information provided that enabled him to safely facilitate his objectives, in particular, the requirement for frequent checking of blood glucose levels, the effects of altitude on insulin dose requirements, and recognition that acute mountain sickness may mimic the symptoms of hypoglycaemia and vice versa. Real-time continuous glucose monitoring was made available for his treks. RESULTS: The effects of high altitude on blood glucose results and glycaemic variability while treated on multiple daily injections of insulin are reported. In addition, we present a first-person account of his experience and lessons learnt from managing diabetes at high altitude.

METHODS: The study group consisted of 186 patients (F/M; 87/99) at onset of T1D and 24 months of follow-up. Partial CR was defined as insulin requirement <0.5 IU/kg and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) <7%. RESULTS: Partial CR was observed in 115/186 (61.83%) of patients. At diagnosis body mass index standard deviation (BMI SDS) was higher among remitters than in non-remitters (p=0.0051) and remitters were younger (p=0.0029). In the follow-up a higher triglyceride concentration in non-remitters compared to remitters (p=0.0455) and a lower high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level (p=0.0119) were noticed. CONCLUSIONS: Younger age and higher BMI at diagnosis of T1D can predispose to partial CR in children. In patients with CR of T1D after 2 years of follow-up a lipid profile improvement is observed.","type+1+diabetes",["BACKGROUND:","The","aim","of","the","study","was","to","compare","the","selected","markers","in","children","with","and","without","partial","clinical","remission","(CR)","of","newly","diagnosed","type","1","diabetes","(T1D).","METHODS:","The","study","group","consisted","of","186","patients","(F/M;","87/99)","at","onset","of","T1D","and","24","months","of","follow-up.","Partial","CR","was","defined","as","insulin","requirement","<0.5","IU/kg","and","glycated","hemoglobin","(HbA1c)","<7%.","RESULTS:","Partial","CR","was","observed","in","115/186","(61.83%)","of","patients.","At","diagnosis","body","mass","index","standard","deviation","(BMI","SDS)","was","higher","among","remitters","than","in","non-remitters","(p=0.0051)","and","remitters","were","younger","(p=0.0029).","In","the","follow-up","a","higher","triglyceride","concentration","in","non-remitters","compared","to","remitters","(p=0.0455)","and","a","lower","high","density","lipoprotein","(HDL)","cholesterol","level","(p=0.0119)","were","noticed.","CONCLUSIONS:","Younger","age","and","higher","BMI","at","diagnosis","of","T1D","can","predispose","to","partial","CR","in","children.","In","patients","with","CR","of","T1D","after","2","years","of","follow-up","a","lipid","profile","improvement","is","observed."],["BACKGROUND:","aim","study","compare","selected","markers","children","without","partial","clinical","remission","(CR)","newly","diagnosed","type","1","diabetes","(T1D).","METHODS:","study","group","consisted","186","patients","(F/M;","87/99)","onset","T1D","24","months","follow-up.","Partial","CR","defined","insulin","requirement","<0.5","IU/kg","glycated","hemoglobin","(HbA1c)","<7%.","RESULTS:","Partial","CR","observed","115/186","(61.83%)","patients.","diagnosis","body","mass","index","standard","deviation","(BMI","SDS)","higher","among","remitters","non-remitters","(p=0.0051)","remitters","younger","(p=0.0029).","follow-up","higher","triglyceride","concentration","non-remitters","compared","remitters","(p=0.0455)","lower","high","density","lipoprotein","(HDL)","cholesterol","level","(p=0.0119)","noticed.","CONCLUSIONS:","Younger","age","higher","BMI","diagnosis","T1D","predispose","partial","CR","children.","patients","CR","T1D","2","years","follow-up","lipid","profile","improvement","observed."],[0,300,[1,8,22,24,26,28,39,40,41,42,43,45,46,48,49,55,62,67,68,72,78,84,86,87,89,91,92,99,100,102,104,105,106,110,115,116,119,124,127,129,131,132,134,136,138,139,143,144,146,148,150,152,160,161,162,165,171,173,180,184,197,200,207,212,216,217,222,223,225,231,236,245,249,252,258,268,283,290],[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0]],[0,300,[1,8,22,24,26,28,39,40,41,42,43,45,46,48,49,55,62,67,68,72,78,84,86,87,89,91,92,99,100,102,104,105,106,110,115,116,119,124,127,129,131,132,134,136,138,139,143,144,146,148,150,152,160,161,162,165,171,173,180,184,197,200,207,212,216,217,222,223,225,231,236,245,249,252,258,268,283,290],[0.895956107136749,0.94710361830369,1.158412711970897,0.4963561184809827,1.7717007423116262,1.1288422546497774,1.6068397084302988,1.0154719451674472,1.0711012599602607,0.8464187394514634,3.7981301284897873,1.1729232446853115,0.9374323630385122,1.0733039040226031,1.1431203801211496,0.8289966960047991,1.2472534875491068,1.162020653347096,1.3467547565464346,0.9024406134160099,1.7201315501030985,1.380656308222116,5.278363310422449,1.5881803526980935,1.2318744805480126,0.7071918221205956,2.5780657887759224,0.7311774981052004,4.150265915494761,1.216489561708533,1.0967294035326587,0.9637625042903288,1.5789975517157584,2.0836617553202954,1.0922248914115542,1.5487684369011347,1.456957896680049,1.4831889088289185,2.708055031751029,0.8561318400979634,1.4634514259905973,3.765158593753081,1.014431903472033,0.8084831561716962,1.4313973997005138,0.8490584242222367,1.458577330232352,0.6830214611927826,1.0185985761668792,1.1524282536556567,1.4553410814531436,1.3988111185024876,1.252762968495368,1.216489561708533,1.219037333787332,1.2767961679395243,1.147666339895413,1.0989892915000963,1.6729165546259006,1.0354410795613767,1.2076231325028917,1.4064739912480568,1.2863006522510883,0.9183660085363332,0.9807036169791469,1.3083705135381192,2.302471295341067,1.2038471682933567,1.0821633196661193,1.2435705203112037,1.08327628583554,0.9089674431126944,0.9897899995351042,0.9989597020949569,2.68772079704014,1.022782682689453,1.2409595527704835,3.8344452995686136]],1.0],["MicroRNA

EC-17-0248. doi: 10.1530/EC-17-0248.","MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression. Growing evidence indicates that miRNAs have a key role in processes involved in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) pathogenesis, including immune system functions and beta-cell metabolism and death. Although dysregulated miRNA profiles have been identified in T1DM patients, results are inconclusive; with only few miRNAs being consistently dysregulated among studies. Thus, we performed a systematic review of the literature on the subject, followed by bioinformatics analysis, to point out which miRNAs are dysregulated in T1DM-related tissues and in which pathways they act. PubMed and EMBASE were searched to identify all studies that compared miRNA expressions between T1DM patients and non-diabetic controls. Those miRNAs consistently dysregulated in T1DM-related tissues were submitted to bioinformatics analysis to retrieve their putative targets and identify potentially affected pathways under their regulation. As result, twenty-nine studies were included in the systematic review. Among 249 dysregulated miRNAs reported in these studies, 63 (25.4%) were reported in at least 2 studies; however, only 34 of them were analyzed in tissues directly related to T1DM pathogenesis [serum/plasma, pancreas, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)]. Regarding circulating miRNAs, 8 were consistently dysregulated in T1DM patients compared to controls: miR-21-5p, miR-146a-5p, miR-148a-3p, miR-181a-5p, miR-210-5p, miR-342-3p, miR-375 and miR-1275.

Whether and to what extent musculoskeletal impairment is present in childhood and adolescence has yet to be determined. The aim of this study was to assess volumetric bone mineral density (BMD) and dynamic muscle function in adolescents with T1D and to assess the clinical and biochemical predictors of their musculoskeletal system. METHODS: Ninety-five children and adolescents (59 boys and 36 girls, mean age 16.2+/-1.2years) with T1D were included in this cross-sectional study. Study participants were divided into two groups according to the duration of the disease (<6years and >9years, respectively). Volumetric BMD of the non-dominant tibia was assessed using peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT). Dynamic muscle function was evaluated using jumping mechanography. Gender- and height-specific Z-scores were calculated using published reference data. HbA1c was evaluated retrospectively as an average over the past 5years. RESULTS: Relative muscle power (Pmax/mass) and force (Fmax/body weight) were significantly decreased in T1D subjects (mean Z-scores -0.4+/-1.0; p<0.001, and -0.3+/-1.1; p<0.01, respectively). The duration of T1D negatively affected Pmax/mass (p<0.01) but not Fmax/body weight (p=0.54). Patients with T1D had also decreased trabecular BMD, the Strength-Strain Index and cortical thickness (mean Z-scores -0.8+/-1.3; -0.5+/-0.8 and -1.1+/-0.8, respectively, p<0.001 for all) whereas cortical BMD was increased when compared to controls (Z-score 1.2+/-0.90, p<0.001). No association was observed between the HbA1c and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and bone or muscle parameters. CONCLUSION: T1D influences the musculoskeletal system in adolescence.

METHODS: This comparative study involved 64 children, 32 children with type 1 diabetes and 32 age- and gender-matched controls. Oral health examination was conducted using WHO criteria. Dental caries experience was recorded using DMFT/dmft index and periodontal parameters were assessed using plaque, gingivitis, gingival bleeding and calculus indexes. Dental caries and periodontal parameters between the two groups were compared using the Mann-Whitney U-test. RESULTS: Children with diabetes exhibited significantly greater plaque deposits (p=0.01) and a higher mean plaque index (p<0.01), when compared to healthy subjects. No significant difference in DMFT and dmft scores, mean bleeding index, calculus index and gingival index was found between the two groups.

(A/California/04/2009) pandemic, mass vaccination with a squalene-containing vaccine, Pandemrix(R), was performed in Sweden and Finland. The vaccination was found to cause narcolepsy in children and young adults with the HLA-DQ 6.2 haplotype. The aim of this study was to investigate if exposure to Pandemrix(R) similarly increased the risk of islet autoimmunity or type 1 diabetes. METHODS: In The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) study, children are followed prospectively for the development of islet autoimmunity and type 1 diabetes. In October 2009, when the mass vaccination began, 3401 children at risk for islet autoimmunity and type 1 diabetes were followed in Sweden and Finland. Vaccinations were recorded and autoantibodies against insulin, GAD65 and insulinoma-associated protein 2 were ascertained quarterly before the age of 4 years and semi-annually thereafter. RESULTS: By 5 August 2010, 2413 of the 3401 (71%) children observed as at risk for an islet autoantibody or type 1 diabetes on 1 October 2009 had been vaccinated with Pandemrix(R). By 31 July 2016, 232 children had at least one islet autoantibody before 10 years of age, 148 had multiple islet autoantibodies and 96 had developed type 1 diabetes. The risk of islet autoimmunity was not increased among vaccinated children. The HR (95% CI) for the appearance of at least one islet autoantibody was 0.75 (0.55, 1.03), at least two autoantibodies was 0.85 (0.57, 1.26) and type 1 diabetes was 0.67 (0.42, 1.07). In Finland, but not in Sweden, vaccinated children had a lower risk of islet autoimmunity (0.47 [0.29, 0.75]), multiple autoantibodies (0.50 [0.28, 0.90]) and type 1 diabetes (0.38 [0.20, 0.72]) compared with those who did not receive Pandemrix(R). The analyses were adjusted for confounding factors. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Children with an increased genetic risk for type 1 diabetes who received the Pandemrix(R) vaccine during the A/H1N1 2009 pandemic had no increased risk of islet autoimmunity, multiple islet autoantibodies or type 1 diabetes. In Finland, the vaccine was associated with a reduced risk of islet autoimmunity and type 1 diabetes.","type+1+diabetes",["AIMS/HYPOTHESIS:","During","the","A/H1N1","2009","(A/California/04/2009)","pandemic,","mass","vaccination","with","a","squalene-containing","vaccine,","Pandemrix(R),","was","performed","in","Sweden","and","Finland.","The","vaccination","was","found","to","cause","narcolepsy","in","children","and","young","adults","with","the","HLA-DQ","6.2","haplotype.","The","aim","of","this","study","was","to","investigate","if","exposure","to","Pandemrix(R)","similarly","increased","the","risk","of","islet","autoimmunity","or","type","1","diabetes.","METHODS:","In","The","Environmental","Determinants","of","Diabetes","in","the","Young","(TEDDY)","study,","children","are","followed","prospectively","for","the","development","of","islet","autoimmunity","and","type","1","diabetes.","In","October","2009,","when","the","mass","vaccination","began,","3401","children","at","risk","for","islet","autoimmunity","and","type","1","diabetes","were","followed","in","Sweden","and","Finland.","Vaccinations","were","recorded","and","autoantibodies","against","insulin,","GAD65","and","insulinoma-associated","protein","2","were","ascertained","quarterly","before","the","age","of","4","years","and","semi-annually","thereafter.","RESULTS:","By","5","August","2010,","2413","of","the","3401","(71%)","children","observed","as","at","risk","for","an","islet","autoantibody","or","type","1","diabetes","on","1","October","2009","had","been","vaccinated","with","Pandemrix(R).","By","31","July","2016,","232","children","had","at","least","one","islet","autoantibody","before","10","years","of","age,","148","had","multiple","islet","autoantibodies","and","96","had","developed","type","1","diabetes.","The","risk","of","islet","autoimmunity","was","not","increased","among","vaccinated","children.","The","HR","(95%","CI)","for","the","appearance","of","at","least","one","islet","autoantibody","was","0.75","(0.55,","1.03),","at","least","two","autoantibodies","was","0.85","(0.57,","1.26)","and","type","1","diabetes","was","0.67","(0.42,","1.07).","In","Finland,","but","not","in","Sweden,","vaccinated","children","had","a","lower","risk","of","islet","autoimmunity","(0.47","[0.29,","0.75]),","multiple","autoantibodies","(0.50","[0.28,","0.90])","and","type","1","diabetes","(0.38","[0.20,","0.72])","compared","with","those","who","did","not","receive","Pandemrix(R).","The","analyses","were","adjusted","for","confounding","factors.","CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION:","Children","with","an","increased","genetic","risk","for","type","1","diabetes","who","received","the","Pandemrix(R)","vaccine","during","the","A/H1N1","2009","pandemic","had","no","increased","risk","of","islet","autoimmunity,","multiple","islet","autoantibodies","or","type","1","diabetes.","In","Finland,","the","vaccine","was","associated","with","a","reduced","risk","of","islet","autoimmunity","and","type","1","diabetes."],["AIMS/HYPOTHESIS:","A/H1N1","2009","(A/California/04/2009)","pandemic,","mass","vaccination","squalene-containing","vaccine,","Pandemrix(R),","performed","Sweden","Finland.","vaccination","found","cause","narcolepsy","children","young","adults","HLA-DQ","6.2","haplotype.","aim","study","investigate","exposure","Pandemrix(R)","similarly","increased","risk","islet","autoimmunity","type","1","diabetes.","METHODS:","Environmental","Determinants","Diabetes","Young","(TEDDY)","study,","children","followed","prospectively","development","islet","autoimmunity","type","1","diabetes.","October","2009,","mass","vaccination","began,","3401","children","risk","islet","autoimmunity","type","1","diabetes","followed","Sweden","Finland.","Vaccinations","recorded","autoantibodies","insulin,","GAD65","insulinoma-associated","protein","2","ascertained","quarterly","age","4","years","semi-annually","thereafter.","RESULTS:","5","August","2010,","2413","3401","(71%)","children","observed","risk","islet","autoantibody","type","1","diabetes","1","October","2009","vaccinated","Pandemrix(R).","31","July","2016,","232","children","least","one","islet","autoantibody","10","years","age,","148","multiple","islet","autoantibodies","96","developed","type","1","diabetes.","risk","islet","autoimmunity","increased","among","vaccinated","children.","HR","(95%","CI)","appearance","least","one","islet","autoantibody","0.75","(0.55,","1.03),","least","two","autoantibodies","0.85","(0.57,","1.26)","type","1","diabetes","0.67","(0.42,","1.07).","Finland,","Sweden,","vaccinated","children","lower","risk","islet","autoimmunity","(0.47","[0.29,","0.75]),","multiple","autoantibodies","(0.50","[0.28,","0.90])","type","1","diabetes","(0.38","[0.20,","0.72])","compared","receive","Pandemrix(R).","analyses","adjusted","confounding","factors.","CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION:","Children","increased","genetic","risk","type","1","diabetes","received","Pandemrix(R)","vaccine","A/H1N1","2009","pandemic","increased","risk","islet","autoimmunity,","multiple","islet","autoantibodies","type","1","diabetes.","F

F","Vantaggiato C","Masiello P","Menegazzi M"],"J Pharm Pharmacol. 2017 Oct 9. doi: 10.1111/jphp.12823.","OBJECTIVES: St John's wort extract (SJW) and its component hyperforin (HPF) were shown to potently inhibit cytokine-induced STAT-1 and NF-kappaB activation in pancreatic beta cells and protect them against injury. This study aimed at exploring the time course of STAT-1 inhibition afforded by these natural compounds in the beta-cell line INS-1E. METHODS: INS-1E cells were pre-incubated with SJW extract (2-5 mug/ml) or HPF (0.5-2 mum) and then exposed to a cytokine mixture. In some experiments, these compounds were added after or removed before cytokine exposure. STAT-1 activation was assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay, apoptosis by caspase-3 activity assay, mRNA gene expression by RT-qPCR. KEY FINDINGS: Pre-incubation with SJW/HPF for 1-2 h exerted a remarkable STAT-1 downregulation, which was maintained upon removal of the compounds before early or delayed cytokine addition. When the protective compounds were added after cell exposure to cytokines, between 15 and 90 min, STAT-1 inhibition also occurred at a progressively decreasing extent. Upon 24-h incubation, SJW and HPF counteracted cytokine-induced beta-cell dysfunction, apoptosis and target gene expression. CONCLUSIONS: SJW and HPF confer to beta cells a state of 'cytokine resistance', which can be elicited both before and after cytokine exposure and safeguards these cells from deleterious cytokine

10.15171/jnp.2017.36. Epub 2017 Apr 5.","BACKGROUND: Proliferative glomerulonephritis with monoclonal IgG deposits (PGNMID) is a newly described and rare entity that can develop in native and very rarely in transplanted kidneys. We present a patient who developed de novo PGNMID in the kidney allograft along with a review of the literature. CASE PRESENTATION: A 38-year old female with type 1 diabetes who underwent successful simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) transplantation 6 years earlier presented with rising serum creatinine, nephrotic range proteinuria and microhematuria. She underwent extensive work up and kidney allograft biopsy revealed mesangial expansion and hypercelluarity on light microscopy, mesangial staining for IgG3, kappa light chains, C1q and C3 on immunofluorescence and abundant mesangial electron dense deposits without substructures on electron microscopy. Serum and urine immunofixation electrophoresis were negative. A diagnosis of de novo PGNMID was made. Patient's proteinuria improved and serum creatinine stabilized with conservative therapy. CONCLUSIONS: PGNMID can rarely develop in kidney allograft as recurrent or de novo disease and may be mislabeled as transplant glomerulopathy if careful immunofluorescence and electron microscopy are not performed on biopsy specimens. Further studies are needed to better understand the pathogenesis of this disease entity and to develop optimal therapeutic approaches.","type+1+diabetes",["BACKGROUND:","Proliferative","glomerulonephritis","with","monoclonal","IgG","deposits","(PGNMID)","is","a","newly","described","and","rare","entity","that","can","develop","in","native","and","very","rarely","in","transplanted","kidneys.","We","present","a","patient","who","developed","de","novo","PGNMID","in","the","kidney","allograft","along","with","a","review","of","the","literature.","CASE","PRESENTATION:","A","38-year","old","female","with","type","1","diabetes","who","underwent","successful","simultaneous","pancreas-kidney","(SPK)","transplantation","6","years","earlier","presented","with","rising","serum","creatinine,","nephrotic","range","proteinuria","and","microhematuria.","She","underwent","extensive","work","up","and","kidney","allograft","biopsy","revealed","mesangial","expansion","and","hypercelluarity","on","light","microscopy,","mesangial","staining","for","IgG3,","kappa","light","chains,","C1q","and","C3","on","immunofluorescence","and","abundant","mesangial","electron","dense","deposits","without","substructures","on","electron","microscopy.","Serum","and","urine","immunofixation","electrophoresis","were","negative.","A","diagnosis","of","de","novo","PGNMID","was","made.","Patient's","proteinuria","improved","and","serum","creatinine","stabilized","with","conservative","therapy.","CONCLUSIONS:","PGNMID","can","rarely","develop","in","kidney","allograft","as","recurrent","or","de","novo","disease","and","may","be","mislabeled","as","transplant","glomerulopathy","if","careful","immunofluorescence","and","electron","microscopy","are","not","performed","on","biopsy","specimens.","Further","studies","are","needed","to","better","understand","the","pathogenesis","of","this","disease","entity","and","to","develop","optimal","therapeutic","approaches."],["BACKGROUND:","Proliferative","glomerulonephritis","monoclonal","IgG","deposits","(PGNMID)","newly","described","rare","entity","develop","native","rarely","transplanted","kidneys.","present","patient","developed","de","novo","PGNMID","kidney","allograft","along","review","literature.","CASE","PRESENTATION:","38-year","old","female","type","1","diabetes","underwent","successful","simultaneous","pancreas-kidney","(SPK)","transplantation","6","years","earlier","presented","rising","serum","creatinine,","nephrotic","range","proteinuria","microhematuria.","underwent","extensive","work","kidney","allograft","biopsy","revealed","mesangial","expansion","hypercelluarity","light","microscopy,","mesangial","staining","IgG3,","kappa","light","chains,","C1q","C3","immunofluorescence","abundant","mesangial","electron","dense","deposits","without","substructures","electron","microscopy.","Serum","urine","immunofixation","electrophoresis","negative.","diagnosis","de","novo","PGNMID","made.","Patient's","proteinuria","improved","serum","creatinine","stabilized","conservative","therapy.","CONCLUSIONS:","PGNMID","rarely","develop","kidney","allograft","recurrent","de","novo","disease","may","mislabeled","transplant","glomerulopathy","careful","immunofluorescence","electron","microscopy","performed","biopsy","specimens.","studies","needed","better","understand","pathogenesis","disease","entity","develop","optimal","therapeutic","approaches."],[0,300,[0,4,5,8,9,16,19,20,22,23,26,28,32,33,36,39,48,53,58,60,64,65,66,71,72,73,75,76,77,81,83,85,87,89,90,105,122,127,129,135,139,144,145,148,153,154,164,165,166,174,175,179,180,183,184,185,188,190,194,199,203,207,209,210,218,220,223,226,227,229,231,233,240,241,243,244,247,256,259,260,261,264,267,270,272,273,274,276,277,278,279,282,283,286,288,295,299],[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0]],[0,300,[0,4,5,8,9,16,19,20,22,23,26,28,32,33,36,39,48,53,58,60,64,65,66,71,72,73,75,76,77,81,83,85,87,89,90,105,122,127,129,135,139,144,145,148,153,154,164,165,166,174,175,179,180,183,184,185,188,190,194,199,203,207,209,210,218,220,223,226,227,229,231,233,240,241,243,244,247,256,259,260,261,264,267,270,272,273,274,276,277,278,279,282,283,286,288,295,299],[1.229293833954521,1.4173016299001202,1.7478814630560007,0.94710361830369,1.0799410965294016,1.340974393630935,1.597448259628875,4.061887780669789,2.316825423941794,1.6181451414000296,0.8858503711558131,1.1288422546497774,1.1988346264698124,2.390183280381956,1.1536222836482644,0.8034198542151494,1.0733039040226031,0.8931898536438588,1.4204168972170694,2.0857996496981053,0.8333238338686806,2.816027274867299,2.3852081534383527,1.1288422546497774,0.9024406134160099,1.0733039040226031,0.9958937824731221,1.3337956119039294,1.386671363951877,4.0272490648435095,2.8735534710818147,0.9908047129656508,1.5881803526980935,

measurement can be used to assess hypoglycaemia risk in insulin-treated type 2 diabetes. METHODS: We compared continuous glucose monitoring-assessed SD of blood glucose and hypoglycaemia duration in 17 patients with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes and severe insulin deficiency (rCP < 200 pmol/l) and 17 matched insulin-treated control patients with type 2 diabetes but who had preserved endogenous insulin (rCP > 600 pmol/l). We then assessed the relationship between rCP and questionnaire-based measures of hypoglycaemia in 256 patients with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes and a comparison group of 209 individuals with type 1 diabetes. RESULTS: Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)-assessed glucose variability and hypoglycaemia was greater in individuals with rCP < 200 pmol/l despite similar mean glucose. In those with low vs high C-peptide, SD of glucose was 4.2 (95% CI 3.7, 4.6) vs 3.0 (2.6, 3.4) mmol/l (p < 0.001). In the low-C-peptide vs high-C-peptide group, the proportion of individuals experiencing sustained hypoglycaemia </= 4 mmol/l was 94% vs 41% (p < 0.001), the mean rate of hypoglycaemia was 5.5 (4.4, 6.7) vs 2.1 (1.4, 2.9) episodes per person per week (p = 0.004) and the mean duration was 630 (619, 643) vs 223 (216, 230) min per person per week (p = 0.01). Hypoglycaemia </= 3 mmol/l was infrequent in individuals with preserved C-peptide (1.8 [1.2, 2.6] episodes per person per week vs 0.4 [0.1, 0.8] episodes per person per week for low vs high C-peptide, p = 0.04) and only occurred at night. In a population-based cohort with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes, self-reported hypoglycaemia was twice as frequent in those with rCP < 200 pmol/l (OR 2.0, p < 0.001) and the rate of episodes resulting in loss of consciousness or seizure was five times higher (OR 5.0, p = 0.001). The relationship between self-reported hypoglycaemia and C-peptide was similar in individuals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Low rCP is associated with increased glucose variability and hypoglycaemia in patients with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes and represents a practical, stable and inexpensive biomarker for assessment of hypoglycaemia risk.","type+1+diabetes",["AIMS/HYPOTHESIS:","The","aim","of","this","study","was","to","determine","whether","random","non-fasting","C-peptide","(rCP)","measurement","can","be","used","to","assess","hypoglycaemia","risk","in","insulin-treated","type","2","diabetes.","METHODS:","We","compared","continuous","glucose","monitoring-assessed","SD","of","blood","glucose","and","hypoglycaemia","duration","in","17","patients","with","insulin-treated","type","2","diabetes","and","severe","insulin","deficiency","(rCP","<","200","pmol/l)","and","17","matched","insulin-treated","control","patients","with","type","2","diabetes","but","who","had","preserved","endogenous","insulin","(rCP",">","600","pmol/l).","We","then","assessed","the","relationship","between","rCP","and","questionnaire-based","measures","of","hypoglycaemia","in","256","patients","with","insulin-treated","type","2","diabetes","and","a","comparison","group","of","209","individuals","with","type","1","diabetes.","RESULTS:","Continuous","glucose","monitoring","(CGM)-assessed","glucose","variability","and","hypoglycaemia","was","greater","in","individuals","with","rCP","<","200","pmol/l","despite","similar","mean","glucose.","In","those","with","low","vs","high","C-peptide,","SD","of","glucose","was","4.2","(95%","CI","3.7,","4.6)","vs","3.0","(2.6,","3.4)","mmol/l","(p","<","0.001).","In","the","low-C-peptide","vs","high-C-peptide","group,","the","proportion","of","individuals","experiencing","sustained","hypoglycaemia","</=","4","mmol/l","was","94%","vs","41%","(p","<","0.001),","the","mean","rate","of","hypoglycaemia","was","5.5","(4.4,","6.7)","vs","2.1","(1.4,","2.9)","episodes","per","person","per","week","(p","=","0.004)","and","the","mean","duration","was","630","(619,","643)","vs","223","(216,","230)","min","per","person","per","week","(p","=","0.01).","Hypoglycaemia","</=","3","mmol/l","was","infrequent","in","individuals","with","preserved","C-peptide","(1.8","[1.2,","2.6]","episodes","per","person","per","week","vs","0.4","[0.1,","0.8]","episodes","per","person","per","week","for","low","vs","high","C-peptide,","p","=","0.04)","and","only","occurred","at","night.","In","a","population-based","cohort","with","insulin-treated","type","2","diabetes,","self-reported","hypoglycaemia","was","twice","as","frequent","in","those","with","rCP","<","200","pmol/l","(OR","2.0,","p","<","0.001)","and","the","rate","of","episodes","resulting","in","loss","of","consciousness","or","seizure","was","five","times","higher","(OR","5.0,","p","=","0.001).","The","relationship","between","self-reported","hypoglycaemia","and","C-peptide","was","similar","in","individuals","with","type","1","and","type","2","diabetes.","CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION:","Low","rCP","is","associated","with","increased","glucose","variability","and","hypoglycaemia","in","patients","with","insulin-treated","type","2","diabetes","and","represents","a","practical,","stable","and","inexpensive","biomarker","for","assessment","of","hypoglycaemia","risk."],["AIMS/HYPOTHESIS:","aim","study","determine","whether","random","non-fasting","C-peptide","(rCP)","measurement","used","assess","hypoglycaemia","risk","insulin-treated","type","2","diabetes.","METHODS:","compared","continuous","glucose","monitoring-assessed","SD","blood","glucose","hypoglycaemia","duration","17","patients","insulin-treated","type","2","diabetes","severe","insulin","deficiency","(rCP","<","200","pmol/l)","17","matched","insulin-treated","control","patients","type","2","diabetes","preserved","endogenous","insulin","(rCP",">","600","pmol/l).","assessed","relationship","rCP","questionnaire-based","measures","hypoglycaemia","256","patients","insulin-treated","type","2","diabetes","comparison","group","209","individuals","type","1","diabetes.","RESULTS:","Continuous","glucose","monitoring","(CGM)-assessed","glucose","variability","hypoglycaemia","greater","individuals","rCP","<","200","pmol/l","despite","similar","mean","glucose.","low","vs","high","C-peptide,","SD","glucose","4.2","(95%","CI","3.7,","4.6)","vs","3.0","(2.6,","3.4)","mmol/l","(p","<","0.001).","low-C-peptide","vs","high-C-peptide","group,","proportion","individuals","experiencing","sustained","hypoglycaemia","</=","4","mmol/l","94%","vs","41%","(p","<","0.001),","mean","rate","hypoglycaemia","5.5","(4.4,","6.7)","vs","2.1","(1.4,","2.9)","episodes","per","person","per","week","(p","=","0.004)","mean","duration","630","(619,","643)","vs","223","(216,","230)","min","per","person","per","week","(p","=","0.01).","Hypoglycaemia","</=","3","mmol/l","infrequent","individuals","preserved","C-peptide","(1.8","[1.2,","2.6]","episodes","per","person","per","week","vs","0.4","[0.1,","0.8]","episodes","per","person","per","week","low","vs","high","C-peptide,","p","=","0.04)","occurred","night.","population-based","cohort","insulin-treated","type","2","diabetes,","self-reported","hypoglycaemia","twice","frequent","rCP","<","200","pmol/l","(OR","2.0,","p","<","0.001)","rate","episode

Oxygen Species and their Implications on CD4+ T cells in Type 1 Diabetes.",["Previte DM","Piganelli JD"],"Antioxid Redox Signal. 2017 Oct 7. doi: 10.1089/ars.2017.7357.","SIGNIFICANCE: Previous work has indicated that Type 1 diabetes (T1D) pathology is highly driven by reactive oxygen species (ROS). One way in which ROS shape the autoimmune response demonstrated in T1D is by promoting CD4+ T cell activation and differentiation. As CD4+ T cells are a significant contributor to pancreatic cell destruction in T1D, understanding how ROS impact their development, activation, and differentiation is critical. Recent advances: CD4+ T cells themselves generate ROS via NADPH oxidase expression and electron transport chain activity. Moreover, T cells can also be exposed to exogenous ROS generated by other immune cells (ex. macrophages and dendritic cells) and cells. Genetically modified animals and ROS inhibitors have demonstrated that ROS blockade during activation results in CD4+ T cell hyporesponsiveness and reduced diabetes incidence. Critical issues and future directions: While the majority of studies with regards to T1D and CD4+ T cells has been done to examine the influence of redox on CD4+ T cell activation, this is not the only circumstance in which a T cell can be impacted by redox. ROS and redox have also been shown to play roles in CD4+ T cell-related tolerogenic mechanisms including thymic selection and regulatory T cell-mediated suppression. However, the effect of these mechanisms with respect to T1D pathogenesis remains elusive. Therefore, pursuing these avenues may provide valuable insight into the global role of ROS and redox in autoreactive CD4+ T cell formation and

gastroparesis in adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) from the T1D Exchange clinic registry.",["Aleppo G","Calhoun P","Foster NC","Maahs DM","Shah VN","Miller KM"],"J Diabetes Complications. 2017 Sep 6. pii: S1056-8727(17)30429-4. doi: 10.1016/j.jdiacomp.2017.08.014.","OBJECTIVE: To better understand the prevalence and impact of gastroparesis in the T1D Exchange clinic registry database. METHODS: The analysis included 7107 adult participants with T1D across 45 sites (median age 46years. and median duration 24years). Linear and logistic regression models were used to assess the association of gastroparesis vs. no gastroparesis (obtained from medical record) with demographic characteristics, glycemic control and diabetes complications. RESULTS: Among 7107 registry participants, 340 (4.8%) had a clinical diagnosis of gastroparesis. Females were more likely to have gastroparesis compared with males (5.8% vs. 3.5%, P<0.001). Participants with gastroparesis compared with those without gastroparesis were older (median age 49.4 vs. 45.3years, P<0.001), had a longer duration of T1D (median duration 32 vs. 23years, P<0.001), higher mean HbA1c (8.1% vs. 7.7% [65 vs. 61mmol/mol], P<0.001), more frequent severe hypoglycemia (25% vs. 11% with >/=1 event in the past 12months, P<0.001), lower socio-economic status, less likely to be using CGM and insulin pump and greater prevalence of microvascular and neuropathic complications than participants without gastroparesis. CONCLUSION: Gastroparesis is associated with higher risk of severe hypoglycemia despite higher HbA1c levels than in T1D patients without gastroparesis. The increased presence of multiple long-term complications and overall poor glycemic control in these subjects emphasizes the need to establish diagnostic protocols for earlier diagnosis, achieve

mellitus (T2DM). Inappropriate glycemic control in patients with T2DM is an important risk factor for the occurrence of diabetes complications. The prevalence of celiac disease (CD) is high in type 1 diabetes mellitus however, there are scarce data about its prevalence in T2DM. Our aim was to investigate the prevalence of celiac disease among insulin-using type 2 diabetes patients with inappropriate glycemic control. METHODS: IgA tissue transglutaminase antibodies (tTGA IgA) test was performed as a screening test. A total of 135 patients with T2DM whose control of glycemia is inappropriate (HbAlc value >7%) in spite of using insulin treatment for at least 3-months (only insulin or insulin with oral antidiabetic drugs) and 115 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with duodenal biopsy was performed to all patients with raised tTGA IgA or selective lgA deficiency. RESULTS: Gender, age, body mass index (BMI) and tTGA IgA, kreatinin, calcium, LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol, 25-OH vitamin D3 levels were similar between groups. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, waist circumference, fasting plasma glucose, postprandial plasma glucose, urea, sodium, HbA1c, LDL-C, triglyceride, vitamin B12 levels were significantly higher in DM group (p < 0.0001). BMI, high-sensitive CRP, microalbuminuria, and AST, ALT, potassium, phosphorus levels were significantly higher in the T2DM group (p < 0.05). HDL-cholesterol and parathormone levels were significantly lower in the T2DM group (p < 0.05). Two of the 135 patients with T2DM were diagnosed with CD (1.45%). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of celiac disease among patients with type 2 diabetes, with poor glycemic control despite insulin therapy, is slightly higher than the actual CD prevalence in general population.

arising via defective immune tolerance. Therefore, effective anti-T1D therapeutics should combine autoimmunity-preventing and insulin production-restoring properties. We constructed a cell-permeable PDX1-FOXP3-TAT fusion protein (FP) composed of two transcription factors: forkhead box P3 (FOXP3), the master regulator of differentiation and functioning of self-tolerance-promoting Tregs, and pancreatic duodenal homeobox-1 (PDX1), the crucial factor supporting beta cell development and maintenance. The FP was tested in vitro and in a non-obese diabetic mouse T1D model. In vitro, FP converted naive CD4+ T cells into a functional \"Treg-like\" subset, which suppressed cytokine secretion, downregulated antigen-specific responses, and curbed viability of diabetogenic effector cells. In hepatic stem-like cells, FP potentiated endocrine transdifferentiation, inducing expression of Insulin2 and other beta lineage-specific genes. In vivo, FP administration to chronically diabetic mice triggered (1) a significant elevation of insulin and C-peptide levels, (2) the formation of insulin-containing cell clusters in livers, and (3) a systemic anti-inflammatory shift (higher Foxp3+CD4+CD25+ T cell frequencies, elevated rates of IL-10-producing cells, and reduced rates of IFN-gamma-secreting cells).

The genetic susceptibility and dominant protection for type 1 diabetes (T1D) associated with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotypes, along with minor risk variants, have long been thought to shape the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire and eventual phenotype of autoreactive T cells that mediate beta-cell destruction. While autoantibodies provide robust markers of disease progression, early studies tracking autoreactive T cells largely failed to achieve clinical utility. RECENT FINDINGS: Advances in acquisition of pancreata and islets from T1D organ donors have facilitated studies of T cells isolated from the target tissues. Immunosequencing of TCR alpha/beta-chain complementarity determining regions, along with transcriptional profiling, offers the potential to transform biomarker discovery. Herein, we review recent studies characterizing the autoreactive TCR signature in T1D, emerging technologies, and the challenges and opportunities associated with tracking TCR molecular profiles during the natural history of T1D.","type+1+diabetes",["PURPOSE","OF","REVIEW:","The","genetic","susceptibility","and","dominant","protection","for","type","1","diabetes","(T1D)","associated","with","human","leukocyte","antigen","(HLA)","haplotypes,","along","with","minor","risk","variants,","have","long","been","thought","to","shape","the","T","cell","receptor","(TCR)","repertoire","and","eventual","phenotype","of","autoreactive","T","cells","that","mediate","beta-cell","destruction.","While","autoantibodies","provide","robust","markers","of","disease","progression,","early","studies","tracking","autoreactive","T","cells","largely","failed","to","achieve","clinical","utility.","RECENT","FINDINGS:","Advances","in","acquisition","of","pancreata","and","islets","from","T1D","organ","donors","have","facilitated","studies","of","T","cells","isolated","from","the","target","tissues.","Immunosequencing","of","TCR","alpha/beta-chain","complementarity","determining","regions,","along","with","transcriptional","profiling,","offers","the","potential","to","transform","biomarker","discovery.","Herein,","we","review","recent","studies","characterizing","the","autoreactive","TCR","signature","in","T1D,","emerging","technologies,","and","the","challenges","and","opportunities","associated","with","tracking","TCR","molecular","profiles","during","the","natural","history","of","T1D."],["PURPOSE","REVIEW:","genetic","susceptibility","dominant","protection","type","1","diabetes","(T1D)","associated","human","leukocyte","antigen","(HLA)","haplotypes,","along","minor","risk","variants,","long","thought","shape","cell","receptor","(TCR)","repertoire","eventual","phenotype","autoreactive","cells","mediate","beta-cell","destruction.","autoantibodies","provide","robust","markers","disease","progression,","early","studies","tracking","autoreactive","cells","largely","failed","achieve","clinical","utility.","RECENT","FINDINGS:","Advances","acquisition","pancreata","islets","T1D","organ","donors","facilitated","studies","cells","isolated","target","tissues.","Immunosequencing","TCR","alpha/beta-chain","complementarity","determining","regions,","along","transcriptional","profiling,","offers","potential","transform","biomarker","discovery.","Herein,","review","recent","studies","characterizing","autoreactive","TCR","signature","T1D,","emerging","technologies,","challenges","opportunities","associated","tracking","TCR","molecular","profiles","natural","history","T1D."],[0,300,[0,4,10,20,26,30,34,35,36,37,38,39,41,43,44,48,50,53,55,58,62,64,71,75,76,78,82,88,91,92,93,94,99,100,104,105,109,113,115,116,120,121,126,130,135,136,143,144,152,158,168,172,175,180,182,183,191,195,196,197,202,225,232,233,234,236,242,244,251,252,259,262,264,268,270,272,273,274,279,284,285,290,294,298,299],[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]],[0,300,[0,4,10,20,26,30,34,35,36,37,38,39,41,43,44,48,50,53,55,58,62,64,71,75,76,78,82,88,91,92,93,94,99,100,104,105,109,113,115,116,120,121,126,130,135,136,143,144,152,158,168,172,175,180,182,183,191,195,196,197,202,225,232,233,234,236,242,244,251,252,259,262,264,268,270,272,273,274,279,284,285,290,294,298,299],[1.229293833954521,1.4173016299001202,0.9627748498890563,1.0154719451674472,0.8858503711558131,1.229293833954521,1.4601993906042199,4.5509277192189055,1.1536222836482644,1.1851783000223266,1.440906187669541,0.8034198542151494,1.0711012599602607,1.2660433761632623,3.1289564807826102,1.0733039040226031,0.9174221670316269,0.8931898536438588,0.8289966960047991,1.4204168972170694,0.6236267437745534,2.4999715016060415,2.2576845092995548,0.9958937824731221,1.3337956119039294,1.7201315501030985,1.2945198766042203,1.2580539861297835,2.121575466361787,1.2890328943879612,0.5682279643847652,1.3453065303700698,0.7311774981052004,3.112699436621071,1.0967294035326587,0.9637625042903288,1.0196429626847854,1.0428998248490526,1.0922248914115542,0.7743842184505674,0.9877636563898717,0.8246882016190752,1.1393871678263923,1.10238872820156,2.740432486450865,0.8084831561716962,1.458577330232352,1.3660429223855652,1.3988111185024876,1.3525687264118544,1.0196429626847854,0.8722323667873726,0.7226004474734408,0.5576388515419669,1.6992974632002564,1.5808273783928346,1.1632261990024446,1.5360571444817295,0.8307253049054169,1.2076231325028917,1.5118345069058832,1.0821633196661193,1.1668515806167616,1.195091640190978,1.217762636355331,2.16655257167108,1.1149531424891101,1.1126569302287599,1.6143500704314782,2.9968791062848705,1.2357579805744103,1.4345569599908823,0.7719342376415829,1.022782682689453,1.3628252265790435,0.9278537457414425,1.0113182527987536,1.2076231325028917,1.2795025295372673,1.3525687264118544,1.0165130696758577,1.2781484331895379,0.5649068055698382,1.695182231

To this end, a longitudinal proteomic profiling of human plasma using TMT-10plex-based LC-MS/MS analysis was performed to track temporal proteomic changes of T1D patients (n=11) across 9 serial time points, spanning the period of T1D natural progression, in comparison with those of the matching healthy controls (n=10). To our knowledge, the current study represents the largest (>2000 proteins measured) longitudinal expression profiles of human plasma proteome in T1D research. By applying statistical trend analysis on the temporal expression patterns between T1D and controls, and Benjamini-Hochberg procedure for multiple-testing correction, 13 protein groups were regarded as having statistically significant differences during the entire follow-up period. Moreover, 16 protein groups, which play pivotal roles in response to oxidative stress, have consistently abnormal expression trend before seroconversion to islet autoimmunity. Importantly, the expression trends of two key reactive oxygen species-decomposing enzymes, Catalase and Superoxide dismutase were verified independently by ELISA. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The temporal changes of >2000 plasma proteins (at least quantified in two subjects), spanning the entire period of T1D natural progression were provided to the research community. Oxidative stress related proteins have consistently different dysregulated patterns in T1D group than in age-sex matched healthy controls, even prior to appearance of islet autoantibodies - the earliest sign of islet autoimmunity and pancreatic beta cell stress.","type+1+diabetes",["Blood","markers","other","than","islet","autoantibodies","are","greatly","needed","to","indicate","the","pancreatic","beta","cell","destruction","process","as","early","as","possible,","and","more","accurately","reflect","the","progression","of","Type","1","Diabetes","Mellitus","(T1D).","To","this","end,","a","longitudinal","proteomic","profiling","of","human","plasma","using","TMT-10plex-based","LC-MS/MS","analysis","was","performed","to","track","temporal","proteomic","changes","of","T1D","patients","(n=11)","across","9","serial","time","points,","spanning","the","period","of","T1D","natural","progression,","in","comparison","with","those","of","the","matching","healthy","controls","(n=10).","To","our","knowledge,","the","current","study","represents","the","largest","(>2000","proteins","measured)","longitudinal","expression","profiles","of","human","plasma","proteome","in","T1D","research.","By","applying","statistical","trend","analysis","on","the","temporal","expression","patterns","between","T1D","and","controls,","and","Benjamini-Hochberg","procedure","for","multiple-testing","correction,","13","protein","groups","were","regarded","as","having","statistically","significant","differences","during","the","entire","follow-up","period.","Moreover,","16","protein","groups,","which","play","pivotal","roles","in","response","to","oxidative","stress,","have","consistently","abnormal","expression","trend","before","seroconversion","to","islet","autoimmunity.","Importantly,","the","expression","trends","of","two","key","reactive","oxygen","species-decomposing","enzymes,","Catalase","and","Superoxide","dismutase","were","verified","independently","by","ELISA.","BIOLOGICAL","SIGNIFICANCE:","The","temporal","changes","of",">2000","plasma","proteins","(at","least","quantified","in","two","subjects),","spanning","the","entire","period","of","T1D","natural","progression","were","provided","to","the","research","community.","Oxidative","stress","related","proteins","have","consistently","different","dysregulated","patterns","in","T1D","group","than","in","age-sex","matched","healthy","controls,","even","prior","to","appearance","of","islet","autoantibodies","-","the","earliest","sign","of","islet","autoimmunity","and","pancreatic","beta","cell","stress."],["Blood","markers","islet","autoantibodies","greatly","needed","indicate","pancreatic","beta","cell","destruction","process","early","possible,","accurately","reflect","progression","Type","1","Diabetes","Mellitus","(T1D).","end,","longitudinal","proteomic","profiling","human","plasma","using","TMT-10plex-based","LC-MS/MS","analysis","performed","track","temporal","proteomic","changes","T1D","patients","(n=11)","across","9","serial","time","points,","spanning","period","T1D","natural","progression,","comparison","matching","healthy","controls","(n=10).","knowledge,","current","study","represents","largest","(>2000","proteins","measured)","longitudinal","expression","profiles","human","plasma","proteome","T1D","research.","applying","statistical","trend","analysis","temporal","expression","patterns","T1D","controls,","Benjamini-Hochberg","procedure","multiple-testing","correction,","13","protein","groups","regarded","statistically","significant","differences","entire","follow-up","period.","Moreover,","16","protein","groups,","play","pivotal","roles","response","oxidative","stress,","consistently","abnormal","expression","trend","seroconversion","islet","autoimmunity.","Importantly,","expression","trends","two","key","reactive","oxygen","species-decomposing","enzymes,","Catalase","Superoxide","dismutase","verified","independently","ELISA.","BIOLOGICAL","SIGNIFICANCE:","temporal","changes",">2000","plasma","proteins","(at","least","quantified","two","subjects),","spanning","entire","period","T1D","natural","progression","provided","research","community.","Oxidative","stress","related","proteins","consistently","different","dysregulated","patterns","T1D","group","age-sex","matched","healthy","controls,","even","prior","appearance","islet","autoantibodies","-","earliest","sign","islet","autoimmunity","pancreatic","beta","cell","stress."],[0,300,[4,6,7,9,10,12,15,22,23,24,27,28,36,39,41,43,45,46,47,49,50,53,54,55,62,63,64,69,72,75,78,83,85,92,93,99,100,103,104,109,110,111,121,122,123,128,131,133,134,135,142,144,157,160,163,165,166,168,170,172,173,174,177,181,183,184,185,186,187,189,191,192,193,195,196,201,205,208,209,210,211,214,221,222,225,227,232,236,237,241,244,246,249,251,252,253,256,257,263,267,272,273,276,277,279,281,285,289,290,293,294,297,299],[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,7.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1

doi: 10.3389/fendo.2017.00246. eCollection 2017.","Natural killer (NK) cells represent an important effector arm against viral infection, and mounting evidence suggests that viral infection plays a role in the development of type 1 diabetes (T1D) in at least a portion of patients. NK cells recognize their target cells through a delicate balance of inhibitory and stimulatory receptors on their surface. If unbalanced, NK cells have great potential to wreak havoc in the pancreas due to the beta cell expression of the as-yet-defined NKp46 ligand through interactions with the activating NKp46 receptor found on the surface of most NK cells. Blocking interactions between NKp46 and its ligand protects mice from STZ-induced diabetes, but differential expression non-diabetic and diabetic donor samples have not been tested. Additional studies have shown that peripheral blood NK cells from human T1D patients have altered phenotypes that reduce the lytic and functional ability of the NK cells. Investigations of humanT1D pancreas tissues have indicated that the presence of NK cells may be beneficial despite their infrequent detection. In non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, we have noted that NK cells express high levels of the proinflammatory mediator 12/15-lipoxygenase (12/15-LO), and decreased levels of stimulatory receptors. Conversely, NK cells of 12/15-LO deficient NOD mice, which are protected from diabetes development, express significantly higher levels of stimulatory receptors. Furthermore, the human NK92 cell line expresses the ALOX12 protein [human 12-lipoxygenase (12-LO), related to mouse 12/15-LO] via Western blotting. Human 12-LO is upregulated in the pancreas of both T1D and T2D human donors with insulin-containing islets, showing a link between 12-LO expression and diabetes progression. Therefore, our hypothesis is that NK cells in those susceptible to developing T1D are unable to function properly during viral infections of pancreatic beta cells due to increased 12-LO expression and activation, which contributes to increased interferon-gamma production and an imbalance in activating and inhibitory NK cell receptors, and may contribute to downstream autoimmune T cell responses. The work presented here outlines evidence from our lab, as well as published literature, supporting our hypothesis, including novel

Epub 2017 Oct 6.","Systemic gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) therapy prevents or ameliorates type 1 diabetes (T1D), by suppressing autoimmune responses and stimulating pancreatic beta cells. In beta cells, it increases insulin secretion, prevents apoptosis, and induces regeneration. It is unclear how GABA mediates these effects. We hypothesized that Klotho is involved. It is a multi-functional protein expressed in the kidneys, brain, pancreatic beta cells, other tissues, and is cell-bound or soluble. Klotho knockout mice display accelerated aging, and in humans Klotho circulating levels decline with age, renal disease and diabetes. Here, we report that GABA markedly increased circulating levels of Klotho in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes. GABA also increased Klotho in the islet of Langerhans of normal mice, as well as the islets and kidneys of STZ-treated mice. In vitro, GABA stimulated production and secretion of Klotho by human islet cells. Knockdown (KD) of Klotho with siRNA in INS-1E insulinoma cells abrogated the protective effects of GABA against STZ toxicity. Following KD, soluble Klotho reversed the effects of Klotho deficiency. In human islet cells soluble Klotho protected against cell death, and stimulated proliferation and insulin secretion. NF-kappaB activation triggers beta-cell apoptosis, and both GABA and Klotho suppress this pathway. We found Klotho KD augmented NF-kappaB p65 expression, and abrogated the ability of GABA to block NF-kappaB activation. This is the first report that GABAergic stimulation increases Klotho expression. Klotho protected and stimulated beta cells and lack of Klotho (KD) was reversed by soluble Klotho.
